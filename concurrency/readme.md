Telnet Server
=============

A simple telnet server for Cisco

Compilation
===========

To compile the server, run
    make

Usage
=====

run 
    telnet_srv

You can provide either of the following arguments:

* "-test"       (without quotes) Runs the server in test mode. This runs the unit tests before starting
* \<portno\>      Supplying a port number will run the server on this port

The server by default will use port 6770

Any command which terminates in the shell used to launch the server without requiring input ought to work

Commands supplied which require input on stdin do not currently work.
