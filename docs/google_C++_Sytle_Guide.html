<p>C++ is one of the main development languages used by many of Google&apos;s open-
source projects. As every C++ programmer knows, the language has many powerful
features, but this power brings with it complexity, which in turn can make
code more bug-prone and harder to read and maintain.</p>
<p>The goal of this guide is to manage this complexity by describing in detail
the dos and don&apos;ts of writing C++ code. These rules exist to keep the code
base manageable while still allowing coders to use C++ language features
productively.</p>
<p><em>Style</em>, also known as readability, is what we call the conventions that
govern our C++ code. The term Style is a bit of a misnomer, since these
conventions cover far more than just source file formatting.</p>
<p>Most open-source projects developed by Google conform to the requirements in
this guide.</p>
<p>Note that this guide is not a C++ tutorial: we assume that the reader is
familiar with the language.</p>
<h3 id="goals-of-the-style-guide"><a name="goals-of-the-style-guide" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#goals-of-the-style-guide"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.1.1. Goals of the Style Guide</h3>
<p>Why do we have this document?</p>
<p>There are a few core goals that we believe this guide should serve. These are
the fundamental <strong>why</strong>s that underlie all of the individual rules. By
bringing these ideas to the fore, we hope to ground discussions and make it
clearer to our broader community why the rules are in place and why particular
decisions have been made. If you understand what goals each rule is serving,
it should be clearer to everyone when a rule may be waived (some can be), and
what sort of argument or alternative would be necessary to change a rule in
the guide.</p>
<p>The goals of the style guide as we currently see them are as follows:</p>
<p>Style rules should pull their weight</p>
<pre><code>The benefit of a style rule must be large enough to justify asking all of our engineers to remember it. The benefit is measured relative to the codebase we would get without the rule, so a rule against a very harmful practice may still have a small benefit if people are unlikely to do it anyway. This principle mostly explains the rules we don&#x2019;t have, rather than the rules we do: for example, `goto` contravenes many of the following principles, but is already vanishingly rare, so the Style Guide doesn&#x2019;t discuss it.
</code></pre><p>Optimize for the reader, not the writer</p>
<pre><code>Our codebase (and most individual components submitted to it) is expected to continue for quite some time. As a result, more time will be spent reading most of our code than writing it. We explicitly choose to optimize for the experience of our average software engineer reading, maintaining, and debugging code in our codebase rather than ease when writing said code. &quot;Leave a trace for the reader&quot; is a particularly common sub-point of this principle: When something surprising or unusual is happening in a snippet of code (for example, transfer of pointer ownership), leaving textual hints for the reader at the point of use is valuable (`std::unique_ptr` demonstrates the ownership transfer unambiguously at the call site). 
</code></pre><p>Be consistent with existing code</p>
<pre><code>Using one style consistently through our codebase lets us focus on other (more important) issues. Consistency also allows for automation: tools that format your code or adjust your `#include`s only work properly when your code is consistent with the expectations of the tooling. In many cases, rules that are attributed to &quot;Be Consistent&quot; boil down to &quot;Just pick one and stop worrying about it&quot;; the potential value of allowing flexibility on these points is outweighed by the cost of having people argue over them. 
</code></pre><p>Be consistent with the broader C++ community when appropriate</p>
<pre><code>Consistency with the way other organizations use C++ has value for the same reasons as consistency within our code base. If a feature in the C++ standard solves a problem, or if some idiom is widely known and accepted, that&apos;s an argument for using it. However, sometimes standard features and idioms are flawed, or were just designed without our codebase&apos;s needs in mind. In those cases (as described below) it&apos;s appropriate to constrain or ban standard features. In some cases we prefer a homegrown or third-party library over a library defined in the C++ Standard, either out of perceived superiority or insufficient value to transition the codebase to the standard interface.
</code></pre><p>Avoid surprising or dangerous constructs</p>
<pre><code>C++ has features that are more surprising or dangerous than one might think at a glance. Some style guide restrictions are in place to prevent falling into these pitfalls. There is a high bar for style guide waivers on such restrictions, because waiving such rules often directly risks compromising program correctness. 
</code></pre><p>Avoid constructs that our average C++ programmer would find tricky or hard to
maintain</p>
<pre><code>C++ has features that may not be generally appropriate because of the complexity they introduce to the code. In widely used code, it may be more acceptable to use trickier language constructs, because any benefits of more complex implementation are multiplied widely by usage, and the cost in understanding the complexity does not need to be paid again when working with new portions of the codebase. When in doubt, waivers to rules of this type can be sought by asking your project leads. This is specifically important for our codebase because code ownership and team membership changes over time: even if everyone that works with some piece of code currently understands it, such understanding is not guaranteed to hold a few years from now.
</code></pre><p>Be mindful of our scale</p>
<pre><code>With a codebase of 100+ million lines and thousands of engineers, some mistakes and simplifications for one engineer can become costly for many. For instance it&apos;s particularly important to avoid polluting the global namespace: name collisions across a codebase of hundreds of millions of lines are difficult to work with and hard to avoid if everyone puts things into the global namespace.
</code></pre><p>Concede to optimization when necessary</p>
<pre><code>Performance optimizations can sometimes be necessary and appropriate, even when they conflict with the other principles of this document.
</code></pre><p>The intent of this document is to provide maximal guidance with reasonable
restriction. As always, common sense and good taste should prevail. By this we
specifically refer to the established conventions of the entire Google C++
community, not just your personal preferences or those of your team. Be
skeptical about and reluctant to use clever or unusual constructs: the absence
of a prohibition is not the same as a license to proceed. Use your judgment,
and if you are unsure, please don&apos;t hesitate to ask your project leads to get
additional input.</p>
<h2 id="header-files"><a name="header-files" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#header-files"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.2. Header Files</h2>
<p>In general, every <code>.cc</code> file should have an associated <code>.h</code> file. There are
some common exceptions, such as unittests and small <code>.cc</code> files containing
just a <code>main()</code> function.</p>
<p>Correct use of header files can make a huge difference to the readability,
size and performance of your code.</p>
<p>The following rules will guide you through the various pitfalls of using
header files.</p>
<h3 id="self-contained-headers"><a name="self-contained-headers" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#self-contained-headers"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.2.1. Self-contained Headers</h3>
<p>Header files should be self-contained (compile on their own) and end in <code>.h</code>.
Non-header files that are meant for inclusion should end in <code>.inc</code> and be used
sparingly.</p>
<p>All header files should be self-contained. Users and refactoring tools should
not have to adhere to special conditions to include the header. Specifically,
a header should have <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#The__define_Guard" target="_blank">header
guards</a>
and include all other headers it needs.</p>
<p>Prefer placing the definitions for template and inline functions in the same
file as their declarations. The definitions of these constructs must be
included into every <code>.cc</code> file that uses them, or the program may fail to link
in some build configurations. If declarations and definitions are in different
files, including the former should transitively include the latter. Do not
move these definitions to separately included header files (<code>-inl.h</code>); this
practice was common in the past, but is no longer allowed.</p>
<p>As an exception, a template that is explicitly instantiated for all relevant
sets of template arguments, or that is a private implementation detail of a
class, is allowed to be defined in the one and only <code>.cc</code> file that
instantiates the template.</p>
<p>There are rare cases where a file designed to be included is not self-
contained. These are typically intended to be included at unusual locations,
such as the middle of another file. They might not use <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#The__define_Guard" target="_blank">header
guards</a>,
and might not include their prerequisites. Name such files with the <code>.inc</code>
extension. Use sparingly, and prefer self-contained headers when possible.</p>
<h3 id="the-define-guard"><a name="the-define-guard" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#the-define-guard"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.2.2. The #define Guard</h3>
<p>All header files should have <code>#define</code> guards to prevent multiple inclusion.
The format of the symbol name should be <code>_&lt;PROJECT&gt;___&lt;PATH&gt;___&lt;FILE&gt;__H_</code>.</p>
<p>To guarantee uniqueness, they should be based on the full path in a project&apos;s
source tree. For example, the file <code>foo/src/bar/baz.h</code> in project <code>foo</code> should
have the following guard:</p>
<pre><code>#ifndef FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
#define FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_

...

#endif  // FOO_BAR_BAZ_H_
</code></pre><h3 id="forward-declarations"><a name="forward-declarations" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#forward-declarations"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.2.3. Forward Declarations</h3>
<p>Avoid using forward declarations where possible. Just <code>#include</code> the headers
you need.</p>
<p>A &quot;forward declaration&quot; is a declaration of a class, function, or template
without an associated definition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward declarations can save compile time, as <code>#include</code>s force the compiler to open more files and process more input.</li>
<li><p>Forward declarations can save on unnecessary recompilation. <code>#include</code>s can force your code to be recompiled more often, due to unrelated changes in the header.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Forward declarations can hide a dependency, allowing user code to skip necessary recompilation when headers change.</p>
</li>
<li>A forward declaration may be broken by subsequent changes to the library. Forward declarations of functions and templates can prevent the header owners from making otherwise-compatible changes to their APIs, such as widening a parameter type, adding a template parameter with a default value, or migrating to a new namespace.</li>
<li>Forward declaring symbols from namespace <code>std::</code> yields undefined behavior.</li>
<li><p>It can be difficult to determine whether a forward declaration or a full <code>#include</code> is needed. Replacing an <code>#include</code> with a forward declaration can silently change the meaning of code: </p>
<pre><code>      // b.h:
  struct B {};
  struct D : B {};

  // good_user.cc:
  #include &quot;b.h&quot;
  void f(B*);
  void f(void*);
  void test(D* x) { f(x); }  // calls f(B*)
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
<p>If the <code>#include</code> was replaced with forward decls for <code>B</code> and <code>D</code>, <code>test()</code>
would call <code>f(void*)</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Forward declaring multiple symbols from a header can be more verbose than simply <code>#include</code>ing the header.</li>
<li><p>Structuring code to enable forward declarations (e.g. using pointer members instead of object members) can make the code slower and more complex.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Try to avoid forward declarations of entities defined in another project.</p>
</li>
<li>When using a function declared in a header file, always <code>#include</code> that header.</li>
<li>When using a class template, prefer to <code>#include</code> its header file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/c
ppguide.html#Names_and_Order_of_Includes" target="_blank">Names and Order of Includes</a> for rules about when to #include a
header.</p>
<h3 id="inline-functions"><a name="inline-functions" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#inline-functions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.2.4. Inline Functions</h3>
<p>Define functions inline only when they are small, say, 10 lines or fewer.</p>
<p>You can declare functions in a way that allows the compiler to expand them
inline rather than calling them through the usual function call mechanism.</p>
<p>Inlining a function can generate more efficient object code, as long as the
inlined function is small. Feel free to inline accessors and mutators, and
other short, performance-critical functions.</p>
<p>Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a
function&apos;s size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease.
Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while
inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern
processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the
instruction cache.</p>
<p>A decent rule of thumb is to not inline a function if it is more than 10 lines
long. Beware of destructors, which are often longer than they appear because
of implicit member- and base-destructor calls!</p>
<p>Another useful rule of thumb: it&apos;s typically not cost effective to inline
functions with loops or switch statements (unless, in the common case, the
loop or switch statement is never executed).</p>
<p>It is important to know that functions are not always inlined even if they are
declared as such; for example, virtual and recursive functions are not
normally inlined. Usually recursive functions should not be inline. The main
reason for making a virtual function inline is to place its definition in the
class, either for convenience or to document its behavior, e.g., for accessors
and mutators.</p>
<h3 id="names-and-order-of-includes"><a name="names-and-order-of-includes" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#names-and-order-of-includes"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.2.5. Names and Order of Includes</h3>
<p>Use standard order for readability and to avoid hidden dependencies: Related
header, C library, C++ library, other libraries&apos; <code>.h</code>, your project&apos;s <code>.h</code>.</p>
<p>All of a project&apos;s header files should be listed as descendants of the
project&apos;s source directory without use of UNIX directory shortcuts <code>.</code> (the
current directory) or <code>..</code> (the parent directory). For example, <code>google-
awesome-project/src/base/logging.h</code> should be included as:</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;base/logging.h&quot;
</code></pre><p>In <code>dir/foo.cc</code> or <code>dir/foo_test.cc</code>, whose main purpose is to implement or
test the stuff in <code>dir2/foo2.h</code>, order your includes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>dir2/foo2.h</code>.</li>
<li>C system files.</li>
<li>C++ system files.</li>
<li>Other libraries&apos; <code>.h</code> files.</li>
<li>Your project&apos;s <code>.h</code> files.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the preferred ordering, if <code>dir2/foo2.h</code> omits any necessary includes,
the build of <code>dir/foo.cc</code> or <code>dir/foo_test.cc</code> will break. Thus, this rule
ensures that build breaks show up first for the people working on these files,
not for innocent people in other packages.</p>
<p><code>dir/foo.cc</code> and <code>dir2/foo2.h</code> are usually in the same directory (e.g.
<code>base/basictypes_test.cc</code> and <code>base/basictypes.h</code>), but may sometimes be in
different directories too.</p>
<p>Within each section the includes should be ordered alphabetically. Note that
older code might not conform to this rule and should be fixed when convenient.</p>
<p>You should include all the headers that define the symbols you rely upon,
except in the unusual case of <a href="https://google.github.io/s
tyleguide/cppguide.html#Forward_Declarations" target="_blank">forward declaration</a>. If you rely on symbols from
<code>bar.h</code>, don&apos;t count on the fact that you included <code>foo.h</code> which (currently)
includes <code>bar.h</code>: include <code>bar.h</code> yourself, unless <code>foo.h</code> explicitly
demonstrates its intent to provide you the symbols of <code>bar.h</code>. However, any
includes present in the related header do not need to be included again in the
related <code>cc</code> (i.e., <code>foo.cc</code> can rely on <code>foo.h</code>&apos;s includes).</p>
<p>For example, the includes in <code>google-awesome-
project/src/foo/internal/fooserver.cc</code> might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;foo/server/fooserver.h&quot;

#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#include &lt;hash_map&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

#include &quot;base/basictypes.h&quot;
#include &quot;base/commandlineflags.h&quot;
#include &quot;foo/server/bar.h&quot;
</code></pre><p>Sometimes, system-specific code needs conditional includes. Such code can put
conditional includes after other includes. Of course, keep your system-
specific code small and localized. Example:</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;foo/public/fooserver.h&quot;

#include &quot;base/port.h&quot;  // For LANG_CXX11.

#ifdef LANG_CXX11
#include &lt;initializer_list&gt;
#endif  // LANG_CXX11
</code></pre><h2 id="scoping"><a name="scoping" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#scoping"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.3. Scoping</h2>
<h3 id="namespaces"><a name="namespaces" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#namespaces"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.3.1. Namespaces</h3>
<p>With few exceptions, place code in a namespace. Namespaces should have unique
names based on the project name, and possibly its path. Do not use <em>using-
directives</em> (e.g. <code>using namespace foo</code>). Do not use inline namespaces. For
unnamed namespaces, see <a href="https://goog
le.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Unnamed_Namespaces_and_Static_Variables" target="_blank">Unnamed Namespaces and Static Variables</a>
.</p>
<p>Namespaces subdivide the global scope into distinct, named scopes, and so are
useful for preventing name collisions in the global scope.</p>
<p>Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large programs
while allowing most code to use reasonably short names.</p>
<p>For example, if two different projects have a class <code>Foo</code> in the global scope,
these symbols may collide at compile time or at runtime. If each project
places their code in a namespace, <code>project1::Foo</code> and <code>project2::Foo</code> are now
distinct symbols that do not collide, and code within each project&apos;s namespace
can continue to refer to <code>Foo</code> without the prefix.</p>
<p>Inline namespaces automatically place their names in the enclosing scope.
Consider the following snippet, for example:</p>
<pre><code>namespace X {
inline namespace Y {
  void foo();
}  // namespace Y
}  // namespace X
</code></pre><p>The expressions <code>X::Y::foo()</code> and <code>X::foo()</code> are interchangeable. Inline
namespaces are primarily intended for ABI compatibility across versions.</p>
<p>Namespaces can be confusing, because they complicate the mechanics of figuring
out what definition a name refers to.</p>
<p>Inline namespaces, in particular, can be confusing because names aren&apos;t
actually restricted to the namespace where they are declared. They are only
useful as part of some larger versioning policy.</p>
<p>In some contexts, it&apos;s necessary to repeatedly refer to symbols by their
fully-qualified names. For deeply-nested namespaces, this can add a lot of
clutter.</p>
<p>Namespaces should be used as follows:</p>
<ul>

<p>Prefer placing nonmember functions in a namespace; use completely global
functions rarely. Prefer grouping functions with a namespace instead of using
a class as if it were a namespace. Static methods of a class should generally
be closely related to instances of the class or the class&apos;s static data.</p>
<p>Nonmember and static member functions can be useful in some situations.
Putting nonmember functions in a namespace avoids polluting the global
namespace.</p>
<p>Nonmember and static member functions may make more sense as members of a new
class, especially if they access external resources or have significant
dependencies.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to define a function not bound to a class instance.
Such a function can be either a static member or a nonmember function.
Nonmember functions should not depend on external variables, and should nearly
always exist in a namespace. Rather than creating classes only to group static
member functions which do not share static data, use
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces" target="_blank">namespaces</a>
instead. For a header <code>myproject/foo_bar.h</code>, for example, write</p>
<pre><code>namespace myproject {
namespace foo_bar {
void Function1();
void Function2();
}  // namespace foo_bar
}  // namespace myproject

<pre><code>namespace myproject {

<p>Place a function&apos;s variables in the narrowest scope possible, and initialize
variables in the declaration.</p>
<p>C++ allows you to declare variables anywhere in a function. We encourage you
to declare them in as local a scope as possible, and as close to the first use
as possible. This makes it easier for the reader to find the declaration and
see what type the variable is and what it was initialized to. In particular,
initialization should be used instead of declaration and assignment, e.g.:</p>
<pre><code>int i;
i = f();      // Bad -- initialization separate from declaration.



int j = g();  // Good -- declaration has initialization.



std::vector&lt;int&gt; v;
v.push_back(1);  // Prefer initializing using brace initialization.
v.push_back(2);



std::vector&lt;int&gt; v = {1, 2};  // Good -- v starts initialized.
</code></pre><p>Variables needed for <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> and <code>for</code> statements should normally be
declared within those statements, so that such variables are confined to those
scopes. E.g.:</p>
<pre><code>while (const char* p = strchr(str, &apos;/&apos;)) str = p + 1;
</code></pre><p>There is one caveat: if the variable is an object, its constructor is invoked
every time it enters scope and is created, and its destructor is invoked every
time it goes out of scope.</p>
<pre><code>// Inefficient implementation:
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {
  Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called 1000000 times each.
  f.DoSomething(i);
}
</code></pre><p>It may be more efficient to declare such a variable used in a loop outside
that loop:</p>
<pre><code>Foo f;  // My ctor and dtor get called once each.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 1000000; ++i) {
  f.DoSomething(i);
}
</code></pre><h3 id="static-and-global-variables"><a name="static-and-global-variables" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#static-and-global-variables"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.3.5. Static and Global Variables</h3>
<p>Variables of class type with <a href="http://en.cppreference
.com/w/cpp/language/storage_duration#Storage_duration" target="_blank"> static storage duration</a> are forbidden: they
cause hard-to-find bugs due to indeterminate order of construction and
destruction. However, such variables are allowed if they are <code>constexpr</code>: they
have no dynamic initialization or destruction.</p>
<p>Objects with static storage duration, including global variables, static
variables, static class member variables, and function static variables, must
be Plain Old Data (POD): only ints, chars, floats, or pointers, or
arrays/structs of POD.</p>
<p>The order in which class constructors and initializers for static variables
are called is only partially specified in C++ and can even change from build
to build, which can cause bugs that are difficult to find. Therefore in
addition to banning globals of class type, we do not allow non-local static
variables to be initialized with the result of a function, unless that
function (such as getenv(), or getpid()) does not itself depend on any other
globals. However, a static POD variable within function scope may be
initialized with the result of a function, since its initialization order is
well-defined and does not occur until control passes through its declaration.</p>
<p>Likewise, global and static variables are destroyed when the program
terminates, regardless of whether the termination is by returning from
<code>main()</code> or by calling <code>exit()</code>. The order in which destructors are called is
defined to be the reverse of the order in which the constructors were called.
Since constructor order is indeterminate, so is destructor order. For example,
at program-end time a static variable might have been destroyed, but code
still running &#x2014; perhaps in another thread &#x2014; tries to access it and fails. Or
the destructor for a static <code>string</code> variable might be run prior to the
destructor for another variable that contains a reference to that string.</p>
<p>One way to alleviate the destructor problem is to terminate the program by
calling <code>quick_exit()</code> instead of <code>exit()</code>. The difference is that
<code>quick_exit()</code> does not invoke destructors and does not invoke any handlers
that were registered by calling <code>atexit()</code>. If you have a handler that needs
to run when a program terminates via <code>quick_exit()</code> (flushing logs, for
example), you can register it using <code>at_quick_exit()</code>. (If you have a handler
that needs to run at both <code>exit()</code> and <code>quick_exit()</code>, you need to register it
in both places.)</p>
<p>As a result we only allow static variables to contain POD data. This rule
completely disallows <code>std::vector</code> (use C arrays instead), or <code>string</code> (use
<code>const char []</code>).</p>
<p>If you need a static or global variable of a class type, consider initializing
a pointer (which will never be freed), from either your main() function or
from pthread_once(). Note that this must be a raw pointer, not a &quot;smart&quot;
pointer, since the smart pointer&apos;s destructor will have the order-of-
destructor issue that we are trying to avoid.</p>

<p>Avoid virtual method calls in constructors, and avoid initialization that can
fail if you can&apos;t signal an error.</p>
<p>It is possible to perform arbitrary initialization in the body of the
constructor.</p>
<ul>
<li>No need to worry about whether the class has been initialized or not.</li>
<li><p>Objects that are fully initialized by constructor call can be <code>const</code> and may also be easier to use with standard containers or algorithms.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the work calls virtual functions, these calls will not get dispatched to the subclass implementations. Future modification to your class can quietly introduce this problem even if your class is not currently subclassed, causing much confusion.</p>
</li>
<li>There is no easy way for constructors to signal errors, short of crashing the program (not always appropriate) or using exceptions (which are <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Exceptions" target="_blank">forbidden</a>).</li>
<li>If the work fails, we now have an object whose initialization code failed, so it may be an unusual state requiring a <code>bool IsValid()</code> state checking mechanism (or similar) which is easy to forget to call.</li>
<li>You cannot take the address of a constructor, so whatever work is done in the constructor cannot easily be handed off to, for example, another thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>Constructors should never call virtual functions. If appropriate for your code
, terminating the program may be an appropriate error handling response.
Otherwise, consider a factory function or <code>Init()</code> method. Avoid <code>Init()</code>
methods on objects with no other states that affect which public methods may
be called (semi-constructed objects of this form are particularly hard to work
with correctly).</p>
<h3 id="implicit-conversions"><a name="implicit-conversions" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#implicit-conversions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.4.2. Implicit Conversions</h3>
<p>Do not define implicit conversions. Use the <code>explicit</code> keyword for conversion
operators and single-argument constructors.</p>
<p>Implicit conversions allow an object of one type (called the source type) to
be used where a different type (called the destination type) is expected, such
as when passing an <code>int</code> argument to a function that takes a <code>double</code>
parameter.</p>
<p>In addition to the implicit conversions defined by the language, users can
define their own, by adding appropriate members to the class definition of the
source or destination type. An implicit conversion in the source type is
defined by a type conversion operator named after the destination type (e.g.
<code>operator bool()</code>). An implicit conversion in the destination type is defined
by a constructor that can take the source type as its only argument (or only
argument with no default value).</p>
<p>The <code>explicit</code> keyword can be applied to a constructor or (since C++11) a
conversion operator, to ensure that it can only be used when the destination
type is explicit at the point of use, e.g. with a cast. This applies not only
to implicit conversions, but to C++11&apos;s list initialization syntax:</p>
<pre><code>class Foo {
  explicit Foo(int x, double y);
  ...
};

void Func(Foo f);



Func({42, 3.14});  // Error
</code></pre><p>This kind of code isn&apos;t technically an implicit conversion, but the language
treats it as one as far as <code>explicit</code> is concerned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Implicit conversions can make a type more usable and expressive by eliminating the need to explicitly name a type when it&apos;s obvious.</li>
<li>Implicit conversions can be a simpler alternative to overloading.</li>
<li><p>List initialization syntax is a concise and expressive way of initializing objects.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Implicit conversions can hide type-mismatch bugs, where the destination type does not match the user&apos;s expectation, or the user is unaware that any conversion will take place.</p>
</li>
<li>Implicit conversions can make code harder to read, particularly in the presence of overloading, by making it less obvious what code is actually getting called.</li>
<li>Constructors that take a single argument may accidentally be usable as implicit type conversions, even if they are not intended to do so.</li>
<li>When a single-argument constructor is not marked <code>explicit</code>, there&apos;s no reliable way to tell whether it&apos;s intended to define an implicit conversion, or the author simply forgot to mark it.</li>
<li>It&apos;s not always clear which type should provide the conversion, and if they both do, the code becomes ambiguous.</li>
<li>List initialization can suffer from the same problems if the destination type is implicit, particularly if the list has only a single element.</li>
</ul>
<p>Type conversion operators, and constructors that are callable with a single
argument, must be marked <code>explicit</code> in the class definition. As an exception,
copy and move constructors should not be <code>explicit</code>, since they do not perform
type conversion. Implicit conversions can sometimes be necessary and
appropriate for types that are designed to transparently wrap other types. In
that case, contact your project leads to request a waiver of this rule.</p>
<p>Constructors that cannot be called with a single argument should usually omit
<code>explicit</code>. Constructors that take a single <code>std::initializer_list</code> parameter
should also omit <code>explicit</code>, in order to support copy-initialization (e.g.
<code>MyType m = {1, 2};</code>).</p>
<h3 id="copyable-and-movable-types"><a name="copyable-and-movable-types" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#copyable-and-movable-types"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.4.3. Copyable and Movable Types</h3>
<p>Support copying and/or moving if these operations are clear and meaningful for
your type. Otherwise, disable the implicitly generated special functions that
perform copies and moves.</p>
<p>A copyable type allows its objects to be initialized or assigned from any
other object of the same type, without changing the value of the source. For
user-defined types, the copy behavior is defined by the copy constructor and
the copy-assignment operator. <code>string</code> is an example of a copyable type.</p>
<p>A movable type is one that can be initialized and assigned from temporaries
(all copyable types are therefore movable). <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;int&gt;</code> is an
example of a movable but not copyable type. For user-defined types, the move
behavior is defined by the move constructor and the move-assignment operator.</p>
<p>The copy/move constructors can be implicitly invoked by the compiler in some
situations, e.g. when passing objects by value.</p>
<p>Objects of copyable and movable types can be passed and returned by value,
which makes APIs simpler, safer, and more general. Unlike when passing objects
by pointer or reference, there&apos;s no risk of confusion over ownership,
lifetime, mutability, and similar issues, and no need to specify them in the
contract. It also prevents non-local interactions between the client and the
implementation, which makes them easier to understand, maintain, and optimize
by the compiler. Further, such objects can be used with generic APIs that
require pass-by-value, such as most containers, and they allow for additional
flexibility in e.g., type composition.</p>
<p>Copy/move constructors and assignment operators are usually easier to define
correctly than alternatives like <code>Clone()</code>, <code>CopyFrom()</code> or <code>Swap()</code>, because
they can be generated by the compiler, either implicitly or with <code>= default</code>.
They are concise, and ensure that all data members are copied. Copy and move
constructors are also generally more efficient, because they don&apos;t require
heap allocation or separate initialization and assignment steps, and they&apos;re
eligible for optimizations such as <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision" target="_blank"> copy
elision</a>.</p>
<p>Move operations allow the implicit and efficient transfer of resources out of
rvalue objects. This allows a plainer coding style in some cases.</p>
<p>Some types do not need to be copyable, and providing copy operations for such
types can be confusing, nonsensical, or outright incorrect. Types representing
singleton objects (<code>Registerer</code>), objects tied to a specific scope
(<code>Cleanup</code>), or closely coupled to object identity (<code>Mutex</code>) cannot be copied
meaningfully. Copy operations for base class types that are to be used
polymorphically are hazardous, because use of them can lead to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing" target="_blank">object
slicing</a>. Defaulted or
carelessly-implemented copy operations can be incorrect, and the resulting
bugs can be confusing and difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>Copy constructors are invoked implicitly, which makes the invocation easy to
miss. This may cause confusion for programmers used to languages where pass-
by-reference is conventional or mandatory. It may also encourage excessive
copying, which can cause performance problems.</p>
<p>Provide the copy and move operations if their meaning is clear to a casual
user and the copying/moving does not incur unexpected costs. If you define a
copy or move constructor, define the corresponding assignment operator, and
vice-versa. If your type is copyable, do not define move operations unless
they are significantly more efficient than the corresponding copy operations.
If your type is not copyable, but the correctness of a move is obvious to
users of the type, you may make the type move-only by defining both of the
move operations.</p>
<p>If your type provides copy operations, it is recommended that you design your
class so that the default implementation of those operations is correct.
Remember to review the correctness of any defaulted operations as you would
any other code, and to document that your class is copyable and/or cheaply
movable if that&apos;s an API guarantee.</p>
<pre><code>class Foo {
 public:
  Foo(Foo&amp;&amp; other) : field_(other.field) {}
  // Bad, defines only move constructor, but not operator=.

 private:
  Field field_;
};
</code></pre><p>Due to the risk of slicing, avoid providing an assignment operator or public
copy/move constructor for a class that&apos;s intended to be derived from (and
avoid deriving from a class with such members). If your base class needs to be
copyable, provide a public virtual <code>Clone()</code> method, and a protected copy
constructor that derived classes can use to implement it.</p>
<p>If you do not want to support copy/move operations on your type, explicitly
disable them using <code>= delete</code> in the <code>public:</code> section:</p>
<pre><code>// MyClass is neither copyable nor movable.
MyClass(const MyClass&amp;) = delete;
MyClass&amp; operator=(const MyClass&amp;) = delete;
</code></pre><h3 id="structs-vs-classes"><a name="structs-vs-classes" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#structs-vs-classes"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.4.4. Structs vs. Classes</h3>
<p>Use a <code>struct</code> only for passive objects that carry data; everything else is a
<code>class</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>struct</code> and <code>class</code> keywords behave almost identically in C++. We add our
own semantic meanings to each keyword, so you should use the appropriate
keyword for the data-type you&apos;re defining.</p>
<p><code>structs</code> should be used for passive objects that carry data, and may have
associated constants, but lack any functionality other than access/setting the
data members. The accessing/setting of fields is done by directly accessing
the fields rather than through method invocations. Methods should not provide
behavior but should only be used to set up the data members, e.g.,
constructor, destructor, <code>Initialize()</code>, <code>Reset()</code>, <code>Validate()</code>.</p>
<p>If more functionality is required, a <code>class</code> is more appropriate. If in doubt,
make it a <code>class</code>.</p>
<p>For consistency with STL, you can use <code>struct</code> instead of <code>class</code> for functors
and traits.</p>
<p>Note that member variables in structs and classes have <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Variable_Names" target="_blank">different naming
rules</a>.</p>
<h3 id="inheritance"><a name="inheritance" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#inheritance"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.4.5. Inheritance</h3>
<p>Composition is often more appropriate than inheritance. When using
inheritance, make it <code>public</code>.</p>
<p>When a sub-class inherits from a base class, it includes the definitions of
all the data and operations that the parent base class defines. In practice,
inheritance is used in two major ways in C++: implementation inheritance, in
which actual code is inherited by the child, and <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Interfaces" target="_blank">interface
inheritance</a>, in
which only method names are inherited.</p>
<p>Implementation inheritance reduces code size by re-using the base class code
as it specializes an existing type. Because inheritance is a compile-time
declaration, you and the compiler can understand the operation and detect
errors. Interface inheritance can be used to programmatically enforce that a
class expose a particular API. Again, the compiler can detect errors, in this
case, when a class does not define a necessary method of the API.</p>
<p>For implementation inheritance, because the code implementing a sub-class is
spread between the base and the sub-class, it can be more difficult to
understand an implementation. The sub-class cannot override functions that are
not virtual, so the sub-class cannot change implementation. The base class may
also define some data members, so that specifies physical layout of the base
class.</p>
<p>All inheritance should be <code>public</code>. If you want to do private inheritance, you
should be including an instance of the base class as a member instead.</p>
<p>Do not overuse implementation inheritance. Composition is often more
appropriate. Try to restrict use of inheritance to the &quot;is-a&quot; case: <code>Bar</code>
subclasses <code>Foo</code> if it can reasonably be said that <code>Bar</code> &quot;is a kind of&quot; <code>Foo</code>.</p>
<p>Make your destructor <code>virtual</code> if necessary. If your class has virtual
methods, its destructor should be virtual.</p>
<p>Limit the use of <code>protected</code> to those member functions that might need to be
accessed from subclasses. Note that <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Access_Control" target="_blank">data members should be
private</a>.</p>
<p>Explicitly annotate overrides of virtual functions or virtual destructors with
an <code>override</code> or (less frequently) <code>final</code> specifier. Older (pre-C++11) code
will use the <code>virtual</code> keyword as an inferior alternative annotation. For
clarity, use exactly one of <code>override</code>, <code>final</code>, or <code>virtual</code> when declaring
an override. Rationale: A function or destructor marked <code>override</code> or <code>final</code>
that is not an override of a base class virtual function will not compile, and
this helps catch common errors. The specifiers serve as documentation; if no
specifier is present, the reader has to check all ancestors of the class in
question to determine if the function or destructor is virtual or not.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-inheritance"><a name="multiple-inheritance" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#multiple-inheritance"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.4.6. Multiple Inheritance</h3>
<p>Only very rarely is multiple implementation inheritance actually useful. We
allow multiple inheritance only when at most one of the base classes has an
implementation; all other base classes must be <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Interfaces" target="_blank">pure
interface</a>
classes tagged with the <code>Interface</code> suffix.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance allows a sub-class to have more than one base class. We
distinguish between base classes that are <em>pure interfaces</em> and those that
have an <em>implementation</em>.</p>
<p>Multiple implementation inheritance may let you re-use even more code than
single inheritance (see
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Inheritance" target="_blank">Inheritance</a>).</p>
<p>Only very rarely is multiple <em>implementation</em> inheritance actually useful.
When multiple implementation inheritance seems like the solution, you can
usually find a different, more explicit, and cleaner solution.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance is allowed only when all superclasses, with the possible
exception of the first one, are <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Interfaces" target="_blank">pure

order to ensure that they remain pure interfaces, they must end with the
<code>Interface</code> suffix.</p>

<p>Classes that satisfy certain conditions are allowed, but not required, to end
with an <code>Interface</code> suffix.</p>
<p>A class is a pure interface if it meets the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has only public pure virtual (&quot;<code>= 0</code>&quot;) methods and static methods (but see below for destructor).</li>
<li>It may not have non-static data members.</li>
<li>It need not have any constructors defined. If a constructor is provided, it must take no arguments and it must be protected.</li>
<li>If it is a subclass, it may only be derived from classes that satisfy these conditions and are tagged with the <code>Interface</code> suffix.</li>
</ul>
<p>An interface class can never be directly instantiated because of the pure
virtual method(s) it declares. To make sure all implementations of the
interface can be destroyed correctly, the interface must also declare a
virtual destructor (in an exception to the first rule, this should not be
pure). See Stroustrup, The C++ Programming Language, 3rd edition, section 12.4

<p>Tagging a class with the <code>Interface</code> suffix lets others know that they must
not add implemented methods or non static data members. This is particularly
important in the case of <a href="https://google.github.io/style
guide/cppguide.html#Multiple_Inheritance" target="_blank">multiple inheritance</a>. Additionally, the interface concept
is already well-understood by Java programmers.</p>
<p>The <code>Interface</code> suffix lengthens the class name, which can make it harder to
read and understand. Also, the interface property may be considered an
implementation detail that shouldn&apos;t be exposed to clients.</p>
<p>A class may end with <code>Interface</code> only if it meets the above requirements. We
do not require the converse, however: classes that meet the above requirements
are not required to end with <code>Interface</code>.</p>
<h3 id="operator-overloading"><a name="operator-overloading" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#operator-overloading"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.4.8. Operator Overloading</h3>
<p>Overload operators judiciously. Do not create user-defined literals.</p>
<p>C++ permits user code to <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/operators" target="_blank">declare overloaded versions of the built-in
operators</a> using the
<code>operator</code> keyword, so long as one of the parameters is a user-defined type.
The <code>operator</code> keyword also permits user code to define new kinds of literals
using <code>operator&quot;&quot;</code>, and to define type-conversion functions such as <code>operator
bool()</code>.</p>
<p>Operator overloading can make code more concise and intuitive by enabling
user-defined types to behave the same as built-in types. Overloaded operators
are the idiomatic names for certain operations (e.g. <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>=</code>, and
<code>&lt;&lt;</code>), and adhering to those conventions can make user-defined types more
readable and enable them to interoperate with libraries that expect those
names.</p>
<p>User-defined literals are a very concise notation for creating objects of
user-defined types.</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a correct, consistent, and unsurprising set of operator overloads requires some care, and failure to do so can lead to confusion and bugs.</li>
<li>Overuse of operators can lead to obfuscated code, particularly if the overloaded operator&apos;s semantics don&apos;t follow convention.</li>
<li>The hazards of function overloading apply just as much to operator overloading, if not more so.</li>
<li>Operator overloads can fool our intuition into thinking that expensive operations are cheap, built-in operations.</li>
<li>Finding the call sites for overloaded operators may require a search tool that&apos;s aware of C++ syntax, rather than e.g. grep.</li>
<li>If you get the argument type of an overloaded operator wrong, you may get a different overload rather than a compiler error. For example, <code>foo &lt; bar</code> may do one thing, while <code>&amp;foo &lt; &amp;bar</code> does something totally different.</li>
<li>Certain operator overloads are inherently hazardous. Overloading unary <code>&amp;</code> can cause the same code to have different meanings depending on whether the overload declaration is visible. Overloads of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, and <code>,</code> (comma) cannot match the evaluation-order semantics of the built-in operators.</li>
<li>Operators are often defined outside the class, so there&apos;s a risk of different files introducing different definitions of the same operator. If both definitions are linked into the same binary, this results in undefined behavior, which can manifest as subtle run-time bugs.</li>
<li>User-defined literals allow the creation of new syntactic forms that are unfamiliar even to experienced C++ programmers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Define overloaded operators only if their meaning is obvious, unsurprising,
and consistent with the corresponding built-in operators. For example, use <code>|</code>
as a bitwise- or logical-or, not as a shell-style pipe.</p>
<p>Define operators only on your own types. More precisely, define them in the
same headers, .cc files, and namespaces as the types they operate on. That
way, the operators are available wherever the type is, minimizing the risk of
multiple definitions. If possible, avoid defining operators as templates,
because they must satisfy this rule for any possible template arguments. If
you define an operator, also define any related operators that make sense, and
make sure they are defined consistently. For example, if you overload <code>&lt;</code>,
overload all the comparison operators, and make sure <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> never return
true for the same arguments.</p>
<p>Prefer to define non-modifying binary operators as non-member functions. If a
binary operator is defined as a class member, implicit conversions will apply
to the right-hand argument, but not the left-hand one. It will confuse your
users if <code>a &lt; b</code> compiles but <code>b &lt; a</code> doesn&apos;t.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t go out of your way to avoid defining operator overloads. For example,
prefer to define <code>==</code>, <code>=</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, rather than <code>Equals()</code>, <code>CopyFrom()</code>,
and <code>PrintTo()</code>. Conversely, don&apos;t define operator overloads just because
other libraries expect them. For example, if your type doesn&apos;t have a natural
ordering, but you want to store it in a <code>std::set</code>, use a custom comparator
rather than overloading <code>&lt;</code>.</p>
<p>Do not overload <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>,</code> (comma), or unary <code>&amp;</code>. Do not overload
<code>operator&quot;&quot;</code>, i.e. do not introduce user-defined literals.</p>
<p>Type conversion operators are covered in the section on [implicit conversions]

<p>When defining a function, parameter order is: inputs, then outputs.</p>
<p>Parameters to C/C++ functions are either input to the function, output from
the function, or both. Input parameters are usually values or <code>const</code>
references, while output and input/output parameters will be pointers to
non-<code>const</code>. When ordering function parameters, put all input-only parameters
before any output parameters. In particular, do not add new parameters to the
end of the function just because they are new; place new input-only parameters
before the output parameters.</p>
<p>This is not a hard-and-fast rule. Parameters that are both input and output
(often classes/structs) muddy the waters, and, as always, consistency with
related functions may require you to bend the rule.</p>

<p>Prefer small and focused functions.</p>
<p>We recognize that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so no hard limit
is placed on functions length. If a function exceeds about 40 lines, think
about whether it can be broken up without harming the structure of the
program.</p>
<p>Even if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in a few
months may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are hard to find.
Keeping your functions short and simple makes it easier for other people to
read and modify your code.</p>
<p>You could find long and complicated functions when working with some code. Do
not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with such a function
proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to debug, or you want to
use a piece of it in several different contexts, consider breaking up the
function into smaller and more manageable pieces.</p>
<h3 id="reference-arguments"><a name="reference-arguments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#reference-arguments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.5.3. Reference Arguments</h3>
<p>All parameters passed by reference must be labeled <code>const</code>.</p>
<p>In C, if a function needs to modify a variable, the parameter must use a
pointer, eg <code>int foo(int *pval)</code>. In C++, the function can alternatively
declare a reference parameter: <code>int foo(int &amp;val)</code>.</p>
<p>Defining a parameter as reference avoids ugly code like <code>(*pval)++</code>. Necessary
for some applications like copy constructors. Makes it clear, unlike with
pointers, that a null pointer is not a possible value.</p>
<p>References can be confusing, as they have value syntax but pointer semantics.</p>
<p>Within function parameter lists all references must be <code>const</code>:</p>
<pre><code>void Foo(const string &amp;in, string *out);
</code></pre><p>In fact it is a very strong convention in Google code that input arguments are
values or <code>const</code> references while output arguments are pointers. Input
parameters may be <code>const</code> pointers, but we never allow non-<code>const</code> reference
parameters except when required by convention, e.g., <code>swap()</code>.</p>
<p>However, there are some instances where using <code>const T*</code> is preferable to
<code>const T&amp;</code> for input parameters. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You want to pass in a null pointer.</li>
<li>The function saves a pointer or reference to the input.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that most of the time input parameters are going to be specified as
<code>const T&amp;</code>. Using <code>const T*</code> instead communicates to the reader that the input
is somehow treated differently. So if you choose <code>const T*</code> rather than <code>const
T&amp;</code>, do so for a concrete reason; otherwise it will likely confuse readers by
making them look for an explanation that doesn&apos;t exist.</p>
<h3 id="function-overloading"><a name="function-overloading" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#function-overloading"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.5.4. Function Overloading</h3>
<p>Use overloaded functions (including constructors) only if a reader looking at
a call site can get a good idea of what is happening without having to first
figure out exactly which overload is being called.</p>
<p>You may write a function that takes a <code>const string&amp;</code> and overload it with
another that takes <code>const char*</code>.</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass {
 public:
  void Analyze(const string &amp;text);
  void Analyze(const char *text, size_t textlen);
};
</code></pre><p>Overloading can make code more intuitive by allowing an identically-named
function to take different arguments. It may be necessary for templatized
code, and it can be convenient for Visitors.</p>
<p>If a function is overloaded by the argument types alone, a reader may have to
understand C++&apos;s complex matching rules in order to tell what&apos;s going on. Also
many people are confused by the semantics of inheritance if a derived class
overrides only some of the variants of a function.</p>
<p>If you want to overload a function, consider qualifying the name with some
information about the arguments, e.g., <code>AppendString()</code>, <code>AppendInt()</code> rather
than just <code>Append()</code>. If you are overloading a function to support variable
number of arguments of the same type, consider making it take a <code>std::vector</code>
so that the user can use an <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Braced_Initializer_List" target="_blank">initializer list
</a>
to specify the arguments.</p>
<h3 id="default-arguments"><a name="default-arguments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#default-arguments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.5.5. Default Arguments</h3>
<p>Default arguments are allowed on non-virtual functions when the default is
guaranteed to always have the same value. Follow the same restrictions as for
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Funct
ion_Overloading" target="_blank">function overloading</a>, and prefer overloaded functions if the readability gained
with default arguments doesn&apos;t outweigh the downsides below.</p>
<p>Often you have a function that uses default values, but occasionally you want
to override the defaults. Default parameters allow an easy way to do this
without having to define many functions for the rare exceptions. Compared to
overloading the function, default arguments have a cleaner syntax, with less
boilerplate and a clearer distinction between &apos;required&apos; and &apos;optional&apos;
arguments.</p>
<p>Defaulted arguments are another way to achieve the semantics of overloaded
functions, so all the <a href="https://google.githu
b.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Function_Overloading" target="_blank">reasons not to overload functions</a> apply.</p>
<p>The defaults for arguments in a virtual function call are determined by the
static type of the target object, and there&apos;s no guarantee that all overrides
of a given function declare the same defaults.</p>
<p>Default parameters are re-evaluated at each call site, which can bloat the
generated code. Readers may also expect the default&apos;s value to be fixed at the
declaration instead of varying at each call.</p>
<p>Function pointers are confusing in the presence of default arguments, since
the function signature often doesn&apos;t match the call signature. Adding function
overloads avoids these problems.</p>
<p>Default arguments are banned on virtual functions, where they don&apos;t work
properly, and in cases where the specified default might not evaluate to the
same value depending on when it was evaluated. (For example, don&apos;t write <code>void
f(int n = counter++);</code>.)</p>
<p>In some other cases, default arguments can improve the readability of their
function declarations enough to overcome the downsides above, so they are
allowed. When in doubt, use overloads.</p>
<h3 id="trailing-return-type-syntax"><a name="trailing-return-type-syntax" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#trailing-return-type-syntax"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.5.6. Trailing Return Type Syntax</h3>
<p>Use trailing return types only where using the ordinary syntax (leading return
types) is impractical or much less readable.</p>
<p>C++ allows two different forms of function declarations. In the older form,
the return type appears before the function name. For example:</p>
<pre><code>int foo(int x);
</code></pre><p>The new form, introduced in C++11, uses the <code>auto</code> keyword before the function
name and a trailing return type after the argument list. For example, the
declaration above could equivalently be written:</p>
<pre><code>auto foo(int x) -&gt; int;
</code></pre><p>The trailing return type is in the function&apos;s scope. This doesn&apos;t make a
difference for a simple case like <code>int</code> but it matters for more complicated
cases, like types declared in class scope or types written in terms of the
function parameters.</p>
<p>Trailing return types are the only way to explicitly specify the return type
of a <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Lam
bda_expressions" target="_blank">lambda expression</a>. In some cases the compiler is able to deduce a lambda&apos;s
return type, but not in all cases. Even when the compiler can deduce it
automatically, sometimes specifying it explicitly would be clearer for
readers.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&apos;s easier and more readable to specify a return type after the
function&apos;s parameter list has already appeared. This is particularly true when
the return type depends on template parameters. For example:</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;class T, class U&gt; auto add(T t, U u) -&gt; decltype(t + u);
</code></pre><p>versus</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;class T, class U&gt; decltype(declval&lt;T&amp;&gt;() + declval&lt;U&amp;&gt;()) add(T t, U u);
</code></pre><p>Trailing return type syntax is relatively new and it has no analogue in
C++-like languages like C and Java, so some readers may find it unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Existing code bases have an enormous number of function declarations that
aren&apos;t going to get changed to use the new syntax, so the realistic choices
are using the old syntax only or using a mixture of the two. Using a single
version is better for uniformity of style.</p>
<p>In most cases, continue to use the older style of function declaration where
the return type goes before the function name. Use the new trailing-return-
type form only in cases where it&apos;s required (such as lambdas) or where, by
putting the type after the function&apos;s parameter list, it allows you to write
the type in a much more readable way. The latter case should be rare; it&apos;s
mostly an issue in fairly complicated template code, which is <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Template_metapro
gramming" target="_blank">discouraged in
most cases</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ownership-and-smart-pointers"><a name="ownership-and-smart-pointers" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#ownership-and-smart-pointers"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.6.1. Ownership and Smart Pointers</h3>
<p>Prefer to have single, fixed owners for dynamically allocated objects. Prefer
to transfer ownership with smart pointers.</p>
<p>&quot;Ownership&quot; is a bookkeeping technique for managing dynamically allocated
memory (and other resources). The owner of a dynamically allocated object is
an object or function that is responsible for ensuring that it is deleted when
no longer needed. Ownership can sometimes be shared, in which case the last
owner is typically responsible for deleting it. Even when ownership is not
shared, it can be transferred from one piece of code to another.</p>
<p>&quot;Smart&quot; pointers are classes that act like pointers, e.g. by overloading the
<code>*</code> and <code>-&gt;</code> operators. Some smart pointer types can be used to automate
ownership bookkeeping, to ensure these responsibilities are met. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/unique_ptr" target="_blank">
<code>std::unique_ptr</code></a> is a
smart pointer type introduced in C++11, which expresses exclusive ownership of
a dynamically allocated object; the object is deleted when the
<code>std::unique_ptr</code> goes out of scope. It cannot be copied, but can be <em>moved</em>
to represent ownership transfer. <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr" target="_blank">
<code>std::shared_ptr</code></a> is a
smart pointer type that expresses shared ownership of a dynamically allocated
object. <code>std::shared_ptr</code>s can be copied; ownership of the object is shared
among all copies, and the object is deleted when the last <code>std::shared_ptr</code> is
destroyed.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&apos;s virtually impossible to manage dynamically allocated memory without some sort of ownership logic.</li>
<li>Transferring ownership of an object can be cheaper than copying it (if copying it is even possible).</li>
<li>Transferring ownership can be simpler than &apos;borrowing&apos; a pointer or reference, because it reduces the need to coordinate the lifetime of the object between the two users.</li>
<li>Smart pointers can improve readability by making ownership logic explicit, self-documenting, and unambiguous.</li>
<li>Smart pointers can eliminate manual ownership bookkeeping, simplifying the code and ruling out large classes of errors.</li>
<li><p>For const objects, shared ownership can be a simple and efficient alternative to deep copying.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ownership must be represented and transferred via pointers (whether smart or plain). Pointer semantics are more complicated than value semantics, especially in APIs: you have to worry not just about ownership, but also aliasing, lifetime, and mutability, among other issues.</p>
</li>
<li>The performance costs of value semantics are often overestimated, so the performance benefits of ownership transfer might not justify the readability and complexity costs.</li>
<li>APIs that transfer ownership force their clients into a single memory management model.</li>
<li>Code using smart pointers is less explicit about where the resource releases take place.</li>
<li><code>std::unique_ptr</code> expresses ownership transfer using C++11&apos;s move semantics, which are relatively new and may confuse some programmers.</li>
<li>Shared ownership can be a tempting alternative to careful ownership design, obfuscating the design of a system.</li>
<li>Shared ownership requires explicit bookkeeping at run-time, which can be costly.</li>
<li>In some cases (e.g. cyclic references), objects with shared ownership may never be deleted.</li>
<li>Smart pointers are not perfect substitutes for plain pointers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If dynamic allocation is necessary, prefer to keep ownership with the code
that allocated it. If other code needs access to the object, consider passing
it a copy, or passing a pointer or reference without transferring ownership.
Prefer to use <code>std::unique_ptr</code> to make ownership transfer explicit. For
example:</p>
<pre><code>std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; FooFactory();
void FooConsumer(std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; ptr);
</code></pre><p>Do not design your code to use shared ownership without a very good reason.
One such reason is to avoid expensive copy operations, but you should only do
this if the performance benefits are significant, and the underlying object is
immutable (i.e. <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;const Foo&gt;</code>). If you do use shared ownership,
prefer to use <code>std::shared_ptr</code>.</p>
<p>Never use <code>std::auto_ptr</code>. Instead, use <code>std::unique_ptr</code>.</p>

<p>Use rvalue references only to define move constructors and move assignment
operators, or for perfect forwarding.</p>
<p>Rvalue references are a type of reference that can only bind to temporary
objects. The syntax is similar to traditional reference syntax. For example,
<code>void f(string&amp;&amp; s);</code> declares a function whose argument is an rvalue
reference to a string.</p>
<ul>
<li>Defining a move constructor (a constructor taking an rvalue reference to the class type) makes it possible to move a value instead of copying it. If <code>v1</code> is a <code>std::vector&lt;string&gt;</code>, for example, then <code>auto v2(std::move(v1))</code> will probably just result in some simple pointer manipulation instead of copying a large amount of data. In some cases this can result in a major performance improvement.</li>
<li>Rvalue references make it possible to write a generic function wrapper that forwards its arguments to another function, and works whether or not its arguments are temporary objects. (This is sometimes called &quot;perfect forwarding&quot;.)</li>
<li>Rvalue references make it possible to implement types that are movable but not copyable, which can be useful for types that have no sensible definition of copying but where you might still want to pass them as function arguments, put them in containers, etc.</li>
<li><p><code>std::move</code> is necessary to make effective use of some standard-library types, such as <code>std::unique_ptr</code>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Rvalue references are a relatively new feature (introduced as part of C++11), and not yet widely understood. Rules like reference collapsing, and automatic synthesis of move constructors, are complicated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Use rvalue references only to define move constructors and move assignment
operators (as described in <a href="https://google.github.

<code>[std::forward](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/forward)</code>, to support
perfect forwarding. You may use <code>std::move</code> to express moving a value from one
object to another rather than copying it.</p>
<h3 id="friends"><a name="friends" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#friends"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.2. Friends</h3>
<p>We allow use of <code>friend</code> classes and functions, within reason.</p>
<p>Friends should usually be defined in the same file so that the reader does not
have to look in another file to find uses of the private members of a class. A
common use of <code>friend</code> is to have a <code>FooBuilder</code> class be a friend of <code>Foo</code> so
that it can construct the inner state of <code>Foo</code> correctly, without exposing
this state to the world. In some cases it may be useful to make a unittest
class a friend of the class it tests.</p>
<p>Friends extend, but do not break, the encapsulation boundary of a class. In
some cases this is better than making a member public when you want to give
only one other class access to it. However, most classes should interact with
other classes solely through their public members.</p>

<ul>
<li>Exceptions allow higher levels of an application to decide how to handle &quot;can&apos;t happen&quot; failures in deeply nested functions, without the obscuring and error-prone bookkeeping of error codes.</li>
<li>Exceptions are used by most other modern languages. Using them in C++ would make it more consistent with Python, Java, and the C++ that others are familiar with.</li>
<li>Some third-party C++ libraries use exceptions, and turning them off internally makes it harder to integrate with those libraries.</li>
<li>Exceptions are the only way for a constructor to fail. We can simulate this with a factory function or an <code>Init()</code> method, but these require heap allocation or a new &quot;invalid&quot; state, respectively.</li>
<li><p>Exceptions are really handy in testing frameworks.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When you add a <code>throw</code> statement to an existing function, you must examine all of its transitive callers. Either they must make at least the basic exception safety guarantee, or they must never catch the exception and be happy with the program terminating as a result. For instance, if <code>f()</code> calls <code>g()</code> calls <code>h()</code>, and <code>h</code> throws an exception that <code>f</code> catches, <code>g</code> has to be careful or it may not clean up properly.</p>
</li>
<li>More generally, exceptions make the control flow of programs difficult to evaluate by looking at code: functions may return in places you don&apos;t expect. This causes maintainability and debugging difficulties. You can minimize this cost via some rules on how and where exceptions can be used, but at the cost of more that a developer needs to know and understand.</li>
<li>Exception safety requires both RAII and different coding practices. Lots of supporting machinery is needed to make writing correct exception-safe code easy. Further, to avoid requiring readers to understand the entire call graph, exception-safe code must isolate logic that writes to persistent state into a &quot;commit&quot; phase. This will have both benefits and costs (perhaps where you&apos;re forced to obfuscate code to isolate the commit). Allowing exceptions would force us to always pay those costs even when they&apos;re not worth it.</li>
<li>Turning on exceptions adds data to each binary produced, increasing compile time (probably slightly) and possibly increasing address space pressure. </li>
<li>The availability of exceptions may encourage developers to throw them when they are not appropriate or recover from them when it&apos;s not safe to do so. For example, invalid user input should not cause exceptions to be thrown. We would need to make the style guide even longer to document these restrictions!</li>
</ul>
<p>On their face, the benefits of using exceptions outweigh the costs, especially
in new projects. However, for existing code, the introduction of exceptions
has implications on all dependent code. If exceptions can be propagated beyond
a new project, it also becomes problematic to integrate the new project into
existing exception-free code. Because most existing C++ code at Google is not
prepared to deal with exceptions, it is comparatively difficult to adopt new
code that generates exceptions.</p>
<p>Given that Google&apos;s existing code is not exception-tolerant, the costs of
using exceptions are somewhat greater than the costs in a new project. The
conversion process would be slow and error-prone. We don&apos;t believe that the
available alternatives to exceptions, such as error codes and assertions,
introduce a significant burden.</p>
<p>Our advice against using exceptions is not predicated on philosophical or
moral grounds, but practical ones. Because we&apos;d like to use our open-source
projects at Google and it&apos;s difficult to do so if those projects use
exceptions, we need to advise against exceptions in Google open-source
projects as well. Things would probably be different if we had to do it all
over again from scratch.</p>
<p>This prohibition also applies to the exception-related features added in
C++11, such as <code>noexcept</code>, <code>std::exception_ptr</code>, and <code>std::nested_exception</code>.</p>

Run-Time Type Information (RTTI)![](./Google C++ Style</h3>
<p>Guide_files/link.png)</p>
<p>Avoid using Run Time Type Information (RTTI).</p>
<p>RTTI allows a programmer to query the C++ class of an object at run time. This
is done by use of <code>typeid</code> or <code>dynamic_cast</code>.</p>
<p>Querying the type of an object at run-time frequently means a design problem.
Needing to know the type of an object at runtime is often an indication that
the design of your class hierarchy is flawed.</p>
<p>Undisciplined use of RTTI makes code hard to maintain. It can lead to type-
based decision trees or switch statements scattered throughout the code, all
of which must be examined when making further changes.</p>
<p>The standard alternatives to RTTI (described below) require modification or
redesign of the class hierarchy in question. Sometimes such modifications are
infeasible or undesirable, particularly in widely-used or mature code.</p>
<p>RTTI can be useful in some unit tests. For example, it is useful in tests of
factory classes where the test has to verify that a newly created object has
the expected dynamic type. It is also useful in managing the relationship
between objects and their mocks.</p>
<p>RTTI is useful when considering multiple abstract objects. Consider</p>
<pre><code>bool Base::Equal(Base* other) = 0;
bool Derived::Equal(Base* other) {
  Derived* that = dynamic_cast&lt;Derived*&gt;(other);
  if (that == NULL)
    return false;
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>RTTI has legitimate uses but is prone to abuse, so you must be careful when
using it. You may use it freely in unittests, but avoid it when possible in
other code. In particular, think twice before using RTTI in new code. If you
find yourself needing to write code that behaves differently based on the
class of an object, consider one of the following alternatives to querying the
type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Virtual methods are the preferred way of executing different code paths depending on a specific subclass type. This puts the work within the object itself.</li>
<li>If the work belongs outside the object and instead in some processing code, consider a double-dispatch solution, such as the Visitor design pattern. This allows a facility outside the object itself to determine the type of class using the built-in type system.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the logic of a program guarantees that a given instance of a base class
is in fact an instance of a particular derived class, then a <code>dynamic_cast</code>
may be used freely on the object. Usually one can use a <code>static_cast</code> as an
alternative in such situations.</p>
<p>Decision trees based on type are a strong indication that your code is on the
wrong track.</p>
<pre><code>if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D1)) {
  ...
} else if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D2)) {
  ...
} else if (typeid(*data) == typeid(D3)) {
...
</code></pre><p>Code such as this usually breaks when additional subclasses are added to the
class hierarchy. Moreover, when properties of a subclass change, it is
difficult to find and modify all the affected code segments.</p>
<p>Do not hand-implement an RTTI-like workaround. The arguments against RTTI
apply just as much to workarounds like class hierarchies with type tags.
Moreover, workarounds disguise your true intent.</p>
<h3 id="casting"><a name="casting" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#casting"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.5. Casting</h3>
<p>Use C++-style casts like <code>static_cast&lt;float&gt;(double_value)</code>, or brace
initialization for conversion of arithmetic types like <code>int64 y = int64{1} &lt;&lt;
42</code>. Do not use cast formats like <code>int y = (int)x</code> or <code>int y = int(x)</code> (but
the latter is okay when invoking a constructor of a class type).</p>
<p>C++ introduced a different cast system from C that distinguishes the types of
cast operations.</p>
<p>The problem with C casts is the ambiguity of the operation; sometimes you are
doing a <em>conversion</em> (e.g., <code>(int)3.5</code>) and sometimes you are doing a <em>cast</em>
(e.g., <code>(int)&quot;hello&quot;</code>). Brace initialization and C++ casts can often help
avoid this ambiguity. Additionally, C++ casts are more visible when searching
for them.</p>
<p>The C++-style cast syntax is verbose and cumbersome.</p>
<p>Do not use C-style casts. Instead, use these C++-style casts when explicit
type conversion is necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use brace initialization to convert arithmetic types (e.g. <code>int64{x}</code>). This is the safest approach because code will not compile if conversion can result in information loss. The syntax is also concise.</li>
<li>Use <code>static_cast</code> as the equivalent of a C-style cast that does value conversion, when you need to explicitly up-cast a pointer from a class to its superclass, or when you need to explicitly cast a pointer from a superclass to a subclass. In this last case, you must be sure your object is actually an instance of the subclass.</li>
<li>Use <code>const_cast</code> to remove the <code>const</code> qualifier (see <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Use_of_const" target="_blank">const</a>).</li>
<li>Use <code>reinterpret_cast</code> to do unsafe conversions of pointer types to and from integer and other pointer types. Use this only if you know what you are doing and you understand the aliasing issues. </li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Run-
Time_Type_Information__RTTI_" target="_blank"> RTTI section</a> for guidance on the use of <code>dynamic_cast</code>.</p>
<h3 id="streams"><a name="streams" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#streams"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.6. Streams</h3>
<p>Use streams where appropriate, and stick to &quot;simple&quot; usages.</p>
<p>Streams are the standard I/O abstraction in C++, as exemplified by the
standard header <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code>. They are widely used in Google code, but only
for debug logging and test diagnostics.</p>
<p>The <code>&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;</code> stream operators provide an API for formatted I/O that is
easily learned, portable, reusable, and extensible. <code>printf</code>, by contrast,
doesn&apos;t even support <code>string</code>, to say nothing of user-defined types, and is
very difficult to use portably. <code>printf</code> also obliges you to choose among the
numerous slightly different versions of that function, and navigate the dozens
of conversion specifiers.</p>
<p>Streams provide first-class support for console I/O via <code>std::cin</code>,
<code>std::cout</code>, <code>std::cerr</code>, and <code>std::clog</code>. The C APIs do as well, but are
hampered by the need to manually buffer the input.</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream formatting can be configured by mutating the state of the stream. Such mutations are persistent, so the behavior of your code can be affected by the entire previous history of the stream, unless you go out of your way to restore it to a known state every time other code might have touched it. User code can not only modify the built-in state, it can add new state variables and behaviors through a registration system.</li>
<li>It is difficult to precisely control stream output, due to the above issues, the way code and data are mixed in streaming code, and the use of operator overloading (which may select a different overload than you expect).</li>
<li>The practice of building up output through chains of <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operators interferes with internationalization, because it bakes word order into the code, and streams&apos; support for localization is <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/libs/locale/doc/html/rationale.html#rationale_why" target="_blank"> flawed</a>.</li>
<li>The streams API is subtle and complex, so programmers must develop experience with it in order to use it effectively. However, streams were historically banned in Google code (except for logging and diagnostics), so Google engineers tend not to have that experience. Consequently, streams-based code is likely to be less readable and maintainable by Googlers than code based on more familiar abstractions.</li>
<li>Resolving the many overloads of <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is extremely costly for the compiler. When used pervasively in a large code base, it can consume as much as 20% of the parsing and semantic analysis time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Use streams only when they are the best tool for the job. This is typically
the case when the I/O is ad-hoc, local, human-readable, and targeted at other
developers rather than end-users. Be consistent with the code around you, and
with the codebase as a whole; if there&apos;s an established tool for your problem,
use that tool instead.</p>
<p>Avoid using streams for I/O that faces external users or handles untrusted
data. Instead, find and use the appropriate templating libraries to handle
issues like internationalization, localization, and security hardening.</p>
<p>If you do use streams, avoid the stateful parts of the streams API (other than
error state), such as <code>imbue()</code>, <code>xalloc()</code>, and <code>register_callback()</code>. Use
explicit formatting functions rather than stream manipulators or formatting
flags to control formatting details such as number base, precision, or
padding.</p>
<p>Overload <code>&lt;&lt;</code> as a streaming operator for your type only if your type
represents a value, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code> writes out a human-readable string representation
of that value. Avoid exposing implementation details in the output of <code>&lt;&lt;</code>; if
you need to print object internals for debugging, use named functions instead
(a method named <code>DebugString()</code> is the most common convention).</p>
<h3 id="preincrement-and-predecrement"><a name="preincrement-and-predecrement" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#preincrement-and-predecrement"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.7. Preincrement and Predecrement</h3>
<p>Use prefix form (<code>++i</code>) of the increment and decrement operators with
iterators and other template objects.</p>
<p>When a variable is incremented (<code>++i</code> or <code>i++</code>) or decremented (<code>\--i</code> or
<code>i--</code>) and the value of the expression is not used, one must decide whether to
preincrement (decrement) or postincrement (decrement).</p>
<p>When the return value is ignored, the &quot;pre&quot; form (<code>++i</code>) is never less
efficient than the &quot;post&quot; form (<code>i++</code>), and is often more efficient. This is
because post-increment (or decrement) requires a copy of <code>i</code> to be made, which
is the value of the expression. If <code>i</code> is an iterator or other non-scalar
type, copying <code>i</code> could be expensive. Since the two types of increment behave
the same when the value is ignored, why not just always pre-increment?</p>
<p>The tradition developed, in C, of using post-increment when the expression
value is not used, especially in <code>for</code> loops. Some find post-increment easier
to read, since the &quot;subject&quot; (<code>i</code>) precedes the &quot;verb&quot; (<code>++</code>), just like in
English.</p>
<p>For simple scalar (non-object) values there is no reason to prefer one form
and we allow either. For iterators and other template types, use pre-
increment.</p>
<h3 id="use-of-const"><a name="use-of-const" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#use-of-const"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.8. Use of const</h3>
<p>Use <code>const</code> whenever it makes sense. With C++11, <code>constexpr</code> is a better
choice for some uses of const.</p>
<p>Declared variables and parameters can be preceded by the keyword <code>const</code> to
indicate the variables are not changed (e.g., <code>const int foo</code>). Class
functions can have the <code>const</code> qualifier to indicate the function does not
change the state of the class member variables (e.g., <code>class Foo { int
Bar(char c) const; };</code>).</p>
<p>Easier for people to understand how variables are being used. Allows the
compiler to do better type checking, and, conceivably, generate better code.
Helps people convince themselves of program correctness because they know the
functions they call are limited in how they can modify your variables. Helps
people know what functions are safe to use without locks in multi-threaded
programs.</p>
<p><code>const</code> is viral: if you pass a <code>const</code> variable to a function, that function
must have <code>const</code> in its prototype (or the variable will need a <code>const_cast</code>).
This can be a particular problem when calling library functions.</p>
<p><code>const</code> variables, data members, methods and arguments add a level of compile-
time type checking; it is better to detect errors as soon as possible.
Therefore we strongly recommend that you use <code>const</code> whenever it makes sense
to do so:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a function guarantees that it will not modify an argument passed by reference or by pointer, the corresponding function parameter should be a reference-to-const (<code>const T&amp;</code>) or pointer-to-const (<code>const T*</code>), respectively.</li>
<li>Declare methods to be <code>const</code> whenever possible. Accessors should almost always be <code>const</code>. Other methods should be const if they do not modify any data members, do not call any non-<code>const</code> methods, and do not return a non-<code>const</code> pointer or non-<code>const</code> reference to a data member.</li>
<li>Consider making data members <code>const</code> whenever they do not need to be modified after construction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>mutable</code> keyword is allowed but is unsafe when used with threads, so
thread safety should be carefully considered first.</p>
<h4 id="where-to-put-the-const"><a name="where-to-put-the-const" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#where-to-put-the-const"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Where to put the const</h4>
<p>Some people favor the form <code>int const *foo</code> to <code>const int* foo</code>. They argue
that this is more readable because it&apos;s more consistent: it keeps the rule
that <code>const</code> always follows the object it&apos;s describing. However, this
consistency argument doesn&apos;t apply in codebases with few deeply-nested pointer
expressions since most <code>const</code> expressions have only one <code>const</code>, and it
applies to the underlying value. In such cases, there&apos;s no consistency to
maintain. Putting the <code>const</code> first is arguably more readable, since it
follows English in putting the &quot;adjective&quot; (<code>const</code>) before the &quot;noun&quot;
(<code>int</code>).</p>
<p>That said, while we encourage putting <code>const</code> first, we do not require it. But
be consistent with the code around you!</p>
<h3 id="use-of-constexpr"><a name="use-of-constexpr" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#use-of-constexpr"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.9. Use of constexpr</h3>
<p>In C++11, use <code>constexpr</code> to define true constants or to ensure constant
initialization.</p>
<p>Some variables can be declared <code>constexpr</code> to indicate the variables are true
constants, i.e. fixed at compilation/link time. Some functions and
constructors can be declared <code>constexpr</code> which enables them to be used in
defining a <code>constexpr</code> variable.</p>
<p>Use of <code>constexpr</code> enables definition of constants with floating-point
expressions rather than just literals; definition of constants of user-defined
types; and definition of constants with function calls.</p>
<p>Prematurely marking something as constexpr may cause migration problems if
later on it has to be downgraded. Current restrictions on what is allowed in
constexpr functions and constructors may invite obscure workarounds in these
definitions.</p>
<p><code>constexpr</code> definitions enable a more robust specification of the constant
parts of an interface. Use <code>constexpr</code> to specify true constants and the
functions that support their definitions. Avoid complexifying function
definitions to enable their use with <code>constexpr</code>. Do not use <code>constexpr</code> to
force inlining.</p>
<h3 id="integer-types"><a name="integer-types" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#integer-types"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.2.7.10. Integer Types</h3>
<p>Of the built-in C++ integer types, the only one used is <code>int</code>. If a program
needs a variable of a different size, use a precise-width integer type from
<code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code>, such as <code>int16_t</code>. If your variable represents a value that
could ever be greater than or equal to 2^31 (2GiB), use a 64-bit type such as
<code>int64_t</code>. Keep in mind that even if your value won&apos;t ever be too large for an
<code>int</code>, it may be used in intermediate calculations which may require a larger
type. When in doubt, choose a larger type.</p>
<p>C++ does not specify the sizes of its integer types. Typically people assume
that <code>short</code> is 16 bits, <code>int</code> is 32 bits, <code>long</code> is 32 bits and <code>long long</code>
is 64 bits.</p>
<p>Uniformity of declaration.</p>
<p>The sizes of integral types in C++ can vary based on compiler and
architecture.</p>
<p><code>&lt;stdint.h&gt;</code> defines types like <code>int16_t</code>, <code>uint32_t</code>, <code>int64_t</code>, etc. You
should always use those in preference to <code>short</code>, <code>unsigned long long</code> and the
like, when you need a guarantee on the size of an integer. Of the C integer
types, only <code>int</code> should be used. When appropriate, you are welcome to use
standard types like <code>size_t</code> and <code>ptrdiff_t</code>.</p>
<p>We use <code>int</code> very often, for integers we know are not going to be too big,
e.g., loop counters. Use plain old <code>int</code> for such things. You should assume
that an <code>int</code> is at least 32 bits, but don&apos;t assume that it has more than 32
bits. If you need a 64-bit integer type, use <code>int64_t</code> or <code>uint64_t</code>.</p>
<p>For integers we know can be &quot;big&quot;, use <code>int64_t</code>.</p>
<p>You should not use the unsigned integer types such as <code>uint32_t</code>, unless there
is a valid reason such as representing a bit pattern rather than a number, or
you need defined overflow modulo 2^N. In particular, do not use unsigned types
to say a number will never be negative. Instead, use assertions for this.</p>
<p>If your code is a container that returns a size, be sure to use a type that
will accommodate any possible usage of your container. When in doubt, use a
larger type rather than a smaller type.</p>
<p>Use care when converting integer types. Integer conversions and promotions can
cause non-intuitive behavior.</p>
<h4 id="on-unsigned-integers"><a name="on-unsigned-integers" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#on-unsigned-integers"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>On Unsigned Integers</h4>
<p>Some people, including some textbook authors, recommend using unsigned types
to represent numbers that are never negative. This is intended as a form of
self-documentation. However, in C, the advantages of such documentation are
outweighed by the real bugs it can introduce. Consider:</p>
<pre><code>for (unsigned int i = foo.Length()-1; i &gt;= 0; --i) ...
</code></pre><p>This code will never terminate! Sometimes gcc will notice this bug and warn
you, but often it will not. Equally bad bugs can occur when comparing signed
and unsigned variables. Basically, C&apos;s type-promotion scheme causes unsigned
types to behave differently than one might expect.</p>
<p>So, document that a variable is non-negative using assertions. Don&apos;t use an
unsigned type.</p>

separate it from the string literal. It is still possible, as usual, to
include length specifiers, etc., after the <code>%</code> when using the <code>PRI*</code> macros.
So, e.g. <code>printf(&quot;x = %30&quot; PRIuS &quot;\n&quot;, x)</code> would expand on 32-bit Linux to
<code>printf(&quot;x = %30&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;\n&quot;, x)</code>, which the compiler will treat as <code>printf(&quot;x =

If you have such structures being shared on disk between 32-bit and 64-bit code, you will need to ensure that they are packed the same on both architectures. Most compilers offer a way to alter structure alignment. For gcc, you can use <code>__attribute__((packed))</code>. MSVC offers <code>#pragma pack()</code> and <code>__declspec(align())</code>.</li>
<li><p>Use the <code>LL</code> or <code>ULL</code> suffixes as needed to create 64-bit constants. For example:</p>
<pre><code>int64_t my_value = 0x123456789LL;
</code></pre><p>uint64_t my_mask = 3ULL &lt;&lt; 48;</p>

<p>Avoid defining macros, especially in headers; prefer inline functions, enums,
and <code>const</code> variables. Name macros with a project-specific prefix. Do not use
macros to define pieces of a C++ API.</p>
<p>Macros mean that the code you see is not the same as the code the compiler
sees. This can introduce unexpected behavior, especially since macros have
global scope.</p>
<p>The problems introduced by macros are especially severe when they are used to
define pieces of a C++ API, and still more so for public APIs. Every error
message from the compiler when developers incorrectly use that interface now
must explain how the macros formed the interface. Refactoring and analysis
tools have a dramatically harder time updating the interface. As a
consequence, we specifically disallow using macros in this way. For example,
avoid patterns like:</p>
<pre><code>class WOMBAT_TYPE(Foo) {
  // ...

 public:
  EXPAND_PUBLIC_WOMBAT_API(Foo)

  EXPAND_WOMBAT_COMPARISONS(Foo, ==, &lt;)
};
</code></pre><p>Luckily, macros are not nearly as necessary in C++ as they are in C. Instead
of using a macro to inline performance-critical code, use an inline function.
Instead of using a macro to store a constant, use a <code>const</code> variable. Instead
of using a macro to &quot;abbreviate&quot; a long variable name, use a reference.
Instead of using a macro to conditionally compile code ... well, don&apos;t do that
at all (except, of course, for the <code>#define</code> guards to prevent double
inclusion of header files). It makes testing much more difficult.</p>
<p>Macros can do things these other techniques cannot, and you do see them in the
codebase, especially in the lower-level libraries. And some of their special
features (like stringifying, concatenation, and so forth) are not available
through the language proper. But before using a macro, consider carefully
whether there&apos;s a non-macro way to achieve the same result. If you need to use
a macro to define an interface, contact your project leads to request a waiver
of this rule.</p>
<p>The following usage pattern will avoid many problems with macros; if you use
macros, follow it whenever possible:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&apos;t define macros in a <code>.h</code> file.</li>
<li><code>#define</code> macros right before you use them, and <code>#undef</code> them right after.</li>
<li>Do not just <code>#undef</code> an existing macro before replacing it with your own; instead, pick a name that&apos;s likely to be unique.</li>
<li>Try not to use macros that expand to unbalanced C++ constructs, or at least document that behavior well.</li>
<li>Prefer not using <code>##</code> to generate function/class/variable names.</li>
</ul>
<p>Exporting macros from headers (i.e. defining them in a header without
<code>#undef</code>ing them before the end of the header) is extremely strongly
discouraged. If you do export a macro from a header, it must have a globally
unique name. To achieve this, it must be named with a prefix consisting of
your project&apos;s namespace name (but upper case).</p>

<p>Use <code>0</code> for integers, <code>0.0</code> for reals, <code>nullptr</code> (or <code>NULL</code>) for pointers, and
<code>&apos;\0&apos;</code> for chars.</p>
<p>Use <code>0</code> for integers and <code>0.0</code> for reals. This is not controversial.</p>
<p>For pointers (address values), there is a choice between <code>0</code>, <code>NULL</code>, and
<code>nullptr</code>. For projects that allow C++11 features, use <code>nullptr</code>. For C++03
projects, we prefer <code>NULL</code> because it looks like a pointer. In fact, some C++
compilers provide special definitions of <code>NULL</code> which enable them to give
useful warnings, particularly in situations where <code>sizeof(NULL)</code> is not equal
to <code>sizeof(0)</code>.</p>
<p>Use <code>&apos;\0&apos;</code> for chars. This is the correct type and also makes code more

<p>Prefer <code>sizeof(varname)</code> to <code>sizeof(type)</code>.</p>
<p>Use <code>sizeof(varname)</code> when you take the size of a particular variable.
<code>sizeof(varname)</code> will update appropriately if someone changes the variable
type either now or later. You may use <code>sizeof(type)</code> for code unrelated to any
particular variable, such as code that manages an external or internal data
format where a variable of an appropriate C++ type is not convenient.</p>

<p>Use <code>auto</code> to avoid type names that are noisy, obvious, or unimportant - cases
where the type doesn&apos;t aid in clarity for the reader. Continue to use manifest
type declarations when it helps readability.</p>
<ul>
<li>C++ type names can be long and cumbersome, especially when they involve templates or namespaces.</li>
<li>When a C++ type name is repeated within a single declaration or a small code region, the repetition may not be aiding readability.</li>
<li>It is sometimes safer to let the type be specified by the type of the initialization expression, since that avoids the possibility of unintended copies or type conversions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes code is clearer when types are manifest, especially when a
variable&apos;s initialization depends on things that were declared far away. In
expressions like:</p>
<pre><code>auto foo = x.add_foo();
auto i = y.Find(key);
</code></pre><p>it may not be obvious what the resulting types are if the type of <code>y</code> isn&apos;t
very well known, or if <code>y</code> was declared many lines earlier.</p>
<p>Programmers have to understand the difference between <code>auto</code> and <code>const auto&amp;</code>
or they&apos;ll get copies when they didn&apos;t mean to.</p>
<p>If an <code>auto</code> variable is used as part of an interface, e.g. as a constant in a
header, then a programmer might change its type while only intending to change
its value, leading to a more radical API change than intended.</p>
<p><code>auto</code> is permitted when it increases readability, particularly as described
below. Never initialize an <code>auto</code>-typed variable with a braced initializer
list.</p>
<p>Specific cases where <code>auto</code> is allowed or encouraged:</p>
<ul>
<li>(Encouraged) For iterators and other long/cluttery type names, particularly when the type is clear from context (calls to <code>find</code>, <code>begin</code>, or <code>end</code> for instance).</li>
<li>(Allowed) When the type is clear from local context (in the same expression or within a few lines). Initialization of a pointer or smart pointer with calls to <code>new</code> commonly falls into this category, as does use of <code>auto</code> in a range-based loop over a container whose type is spelled out nearby.</li>
<li>(Allowed) When the type doesn&apos;t matter because it isn&apos;t being used for anything other than equality comparison.</li>
<li><p>(Encouraged) When iterating over a map with a range-based loop (because it is often assumed that the correct type is <code>std::pair&lt;KeyType, ValueType&gt;</code> whereas it is actually <code>std::pair&lt;const KeyType, ValueType&gt;</code>). This is particularly well paired with local <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> aliases for <code>.first</code> and <code>.second</code> (often const-ref). </p>
<pre><code>for (const auto&amp; item : some_map) {
</code></pre><p>  const KeyType&amp; key = item.first;
  const ValType&amp; value = item.second;
  // The rest of the loop can now just refer to key and value,
  // a reader can see the types in question, and we&apos;ve avoided
  // the too-common case of extra copies in this iteration.
}</p>

<p>You may use braced initializer lists.</p>
<p>In C++03, aggregate types (arrays and structs with no constructor) could be
initialized with braced initializer lists.</p>
<pre><code>struct Point { int x; int y; };
Point p = {1, 2};
</code></pre><p>In C++11, this syntax was generalized, and any object type can now be created
with a braced initializer list, known as a <em>braced-init-list</em> in the C++
grammar. Here are a few examples of its use.</p>
<pre><code>// Vector takes a braced-init-list of elements.
std::vector&lt;string&gt; v{&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;};

// Basically the same, ignoring some small technicalities.
// You may choose to use either form.
std::vector&lt;string&gt; v = {&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;};

// Usable with &apos;new&apos; expressions.
auto p = new vector&lt;string&gt;{&quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;};

// A map can take a list of pairs. Nested braced-init-lists work.
std::map&lt;int, string&gt; m = {{1, &quot;one&quot;}, {2, &quot;2&quot;}};

// A braced-init-list can be implicitly converted to a return type.
std::vector&lt;int&gt; test_function() { return {1, 2, 3}; }

// Iterate over a braced-init-list.
for (int i : {-1, -2, -3}) {}

// Call a function using a braced-init-list.
void TestFunction2(std::vector&lt;int&gt; v) {}
TestFunction2({1, 2, 3});
</code></pre><p>A user-defined type can also define a constructor and/or assignment operator
that take <code>std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</code>, which is automatically created from
<em>braced-init-list</em>:</p>
<pre><code>class MyType {
 public:
  // std::initializer_list references the underlying init list.
  // It should be passed by value.
  MyType(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; init_list) {
    for (int i : init_list) append(i);
  }
  MyType&amp; operator=(std::initializer_list&lt;int&gt; init_list) {
    clear();
    for (int i : init_list) append(i);
  }
};
MyType m{2, 3, 5, 7};
</code></pre><p>Finally, brace initialization can also call ordinary constructors of data
types, even if they do not have <code>std::initializer_list&lt;T&gt;</code> constructors.</p>
<pre><code>double d{1.23};
// Calls ordinary constructor as long as MyOtherType has no
// std::initializer_list constructor.
class MyOtherType {
 public:
  explicit MyOtherType(string);
  MyOtherType(int, string);
};
MyOtherType m = {1, &quot;b&quot;};
// If the constructor is explicit, you can&apos;t use the &quot;= {}&quot; form.
MyOtherType m{&quot;b&quot;};
</code></pre><p>Never assign a <em>braced-init-list</em> to an auto local variable. In the single
element case, what this means can be confusing.</p>
<pre><code>auto d = {1.23};        // d is a std::initializer_list&lt;double&gt;



auto d = double{1.23};  // Good -- d is a double, not a std::initializer_list.

<p>Use lambda expressions where appropriate. Prefer explicit captures when the
lambda will escape the current scope.</p>
<p>Lambda expressions are a concise way of creating anonymous function objects.
They&apos;re often useful when passing functions as arguments. For example:</p>
<pre><code>std::sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int x, int y) {
  return Weight(x) &lt; Weight(y);
});
</code></pre><p>They further allow capturing variables from the enclosing scope either
explicitly by name, or implicitly using a default capture. Explicit captures
require each variable to be listed, as either a value or reference capture:</p>
<pre><code>int weight = 3;
int sum = 0;
// Captures `weight` by value and `sum` by reference.
std::for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), [weight, &amp;sum](int x) {
  sum += weight * x;
});
</code></pre><p>Default captures implicitly capture any variable referenced in the lambda
body, including <code>this</code> if any members are used:</p>
<pre><code>const std::vector&lt;int&gt; lookup_table = ...;
std::vector&lt;int&gt; indices = ...;
// Captures `lookup_table` by reference, sorts `indices` by the value
// of the associated element in `lookup_table`.
std::sort(indices.begin(), indices.end(), [&amp;](int a, int b) {
  return lookup_table[a] &lt; lookup_table[b];
});
</code></pre><p>Lambdas were introduced in C++11 along with a set of utilities for working
with function objects, such as the polymorphic wrapper <code>std::function</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Lambdas are much more concise than other ways of defining function objects to be passed to STL algorithms, which can be a readability improvement.</li>
<li>Appropriate use of default captures can remove redundancy and highlight important exceptions from the default.</li>
<li><p>Lambdas, <code>std::function</code>, and <code>std::bind</code> can be used in combination as a general purpose callback mechanism; they make it easy to write functions that take bound functions as arguments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Variable capture in lambdas can be a source of dangling-pointer bugs, particularly if a lambda escapes the current scope.</p>
</li>
<li>Default captures by value can be misleading because they do not prevent dangling-pointer bugs. Capturing a pointer by value doesn&apos;t cause a deep copy, so it often has the same lifetime issues as capture by reference. This is especially confusing when capturing &apos;this&apos; by value, since the use of &apos;this&apos; is often implicit.</li>
<li><p>It&apos;s possible for use of lambdas to get out of hand; very long nested anonymous functions can make code harder to understand.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use lambda expressions where appropriate, with formatting as described <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Formatting_Lambda_Expressions" target="_blank">below</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Prefer explicit captures if the lambda may escape the current scope. For example, instead of: </p>
<pre><code>{

  executor-&gt;Schedule([&amp;] { Frobnicate(foo); })
  ...
}
// BAD! The fact that the lambda makes use of a reference to <code>foo</code> and
// possibly <code>this</code> (if <code>Frobnicate</code> is a member function) may not be
// apparent on a cursory inspection. If the lambda is invoked after
// the function returns, that would be bad, because both <code>foo</code>
// and the enclosing object could have been destroyed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>prefer to write:</p>
<pre><code>    {
  Foo foo;
  ...
  executor-&gt;Schedule([&amp;foo] { Frobnicate(foo); })
  ...
}
// BETTER - The compile will fail if `Frobnicate` is a member
// function, and it&apos;s clearer that `foo` is dangerously captured by
// reference.
</code></pre><ul>
<li>Use default capture by reference ([&amp;]) only when the lifetime of the lambda is obviously shorter than any potential captures. </li>
<li>Use default capture by value ([=]) only as a means of binding a few variables for a short lambda, where the set of captured variables is obvious at a glance. Prefer not to write long or complex lambdas with default capture by value. </li>
<li>Keep unnamed lambdas short. If a lambda body is more than maybe five lines long, prefer to give the lambda a name, or to use a named function instead of a lambda.</li>
<li>Specify the return type of the lambda explicitly if that will make it more obvious to readers, as with <code>[auto</code>](<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#auto" target="_blank">https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#auto</a>).</li>

<h3 id="template-metaprogramming"><a name="template-metaprogramming" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#template-metaprogramming"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Template metaprogramming<img src="Google C++ Style Guide_files/link.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Avoid complicated template programming.</p>
<p>Template metaprogramming refers to a family of techniques that exploit the
fact that the C++ template instantiation mechanism is Turing complete and can
be used to perform arbitrary compile-time computation in the type domain.</p>
<p>Template metaprogramming allows extremely flexible interfaces that are type
safe and high performance. Facilities like <a href="https://code.google.com/p/googletest/" target="_blank">Google
Test</a>, <code>std::tuple</code>, <code>std::function</code>,
and Boost.Spirit would be impossible without it.</p>
<p>The techniques used in template metaprogramming are often obscure to anyone
but language experts. Code that uses templates in complicated ways is often
unreadable, and is hard to debug or maintain.</p>
<p>Template metaprogramming often leads to extremely poor compiler time error
messages: even if an interface is simple, the complicated implementation
details become visible when the user does something wrong.</p>
<p>Template metaprogramming interferes with large scale refactoring by making the
job of refactoring tools harder. First, the template code is expanded in
multiple contexts, and it&apos;s hard to verify that the transformation makes sense
in all of them. Second, some refactoring tools work with an AST that only
represents the structure of the code after template expansion. It can be
difficult to automatically work back to the original source construct that
needs to be rewritten.</p>
<p>Template metaprogramming sometimes allows cleaner and easier-to-use interfaces
than would be possible without it, but it&apos;s also often a temptation to be
overly clever. It&apos;s best used in a small number of low level components where
the extra maintenance burden is spread out over a large number of uses.</p>
<p>Think twice before using template metaprogramming or other complicated
template techniques; think about whether the average member of your team will
be able to understand your code well enough to maintain it after you switch to
another project, or whether a non-C++ programmer or someone casually browsing
the code base will be able to understand the error messages or trace the flow
of a function they want to call. If you&apos;re using recursive template
instantiations or type lists or metafunctions or expression templates, or
relying on SFINAE or on the <code>sizeof</code> trick for detecting function overload
resolution, then there&apos;s a good chance you&apos;ve gone too far.</p>
<p>If you use template metaprogramming, you should expect to put considerable
effort into minimizing and isolating the complexity. You should hide
metaprogramming as an implementation detail whenever possible, so that user-
facing headers are readable, and you should make sure that tricky code is
especially well commented. You should carefully document how the code is used,
and you should say something about what the &quot;generated&quot; code looks like. Pay
extra attention to the error messages that the compiler emits when users make
mistakes. The error messages are part of your user interface, and your code
should be tweaked as necessary so that the error messages are understandable
and actionable from a user point of view.</p>

<h3 id="stdhash"><a name="stdhash" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#stdhash"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>std::hash<img src="Google C++ Style Guide_files/link.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Do not define specializations of <code>std::hash</code>.</p>
<p><code>std::hash&lt;T&gt;</code> is the function object that the C++11 hash containers use to
hash keys of type <code>T</code>, unless the user explicitly specifies a different hash
function. For example, <code>std::unordered_map&lt;int, string&gt;</code> is a hash map that
uses <code>std::hash&lt;int&gt;</code> to hash its keys, whereas <code>std::unordered_map&lt;int,
string, MyIntHash&gt;</code> uses <code>MyIntHash</code>.</p>
<p><code>std::hash</code> is defined for all integral, floating-point, pointer, and <code>enum</code>
types, as well as some standard library types such as <code>string</code> and
<code>unique_ptr</code>. Users can enable it to work for their own types by defining
specializations of it for those types.</p>
<p><code>std::hash</code> is easy to use, and simplifies the code since you don&apos;t have to
name it explicitly. Specializing <code>std::hash</code> is the standard way of specifying
how to hash a type, so it&apos;s what outside resources will teach, and what new
engineers will expect.</p>
<p><code>std::hash</code> is hard to specialize. It requires a lot of boilerplate code, and
more importantly, it combines responsibility for identifying the hash inputs
with responsibility for executing the hashing algorithm itself. The type
author has to be responsible for the former, but the latter requires expertise
that a type author usually doesn&apos;t have, and shouldn&apos;t need. The stakes here
are high because low-quality hash functions can be security vulnerabilities,
due to the emergence of <a href="https://emboss.github.io/blog/2012/12/14/breaking-murmur-hash-
flooding-dos-reloaded/" target="_blank"> hash flooding
attacks</a>.</p>
<p>Even for experts, <code>std::hash</code> specializations are inordinately difficult to
implement correctly for compound types, because the implementation cannot
recursively call <code>std::hash</code> on data members. High-quality hash algorithms
maintain large amounts of internal state, and reducing that state to the
<code>size_t</code> bytes that <code>std::hash</code> returns is usually the slowest part of the
computation, so it should not be done more than once.</p>
<p>Due to exactly that issue, <code>std::hash</code> does not work with <code>std::pair</code> or
<code>std::tuple</code>, and the language does not allow us to extend it to support them.</p>
<p>You can use <code>std::hash</code> with the types that it supports &quot;out of the box&quot;, but
do not specialize it to support additional types. If you need a hash table
with a key type that <code>std::hash</code> does not support, consider using legacy hash
containers (e.g. <code>hash_map</code>) for now; they use a different default hasher,
which is unaffected by this prohibition.</p>
<p>If you want to use the standard hash containers anyway, you will need to
specify a custom hasher for the key type, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>std::unordered_map&lt;MyKeyType, Value, MyKeyTypeHasher&gt; my_map;
</code></pre><p>Consult with the type&apos;s owners to see if there is an existing hasher that you
can use; otherwise work with them to provide one, or roll your own.</p>
<p>We are planning to provide a hash function that can work with any type, using
a new customization mechanism that doesn&apos;t have the drawbacks of <code>std::hash</code>.</p>

<p>Use libraries and language extensions from C++11 when appropriate. Consider
portability to other environments before using C++11 features in your project.</p>
<p>C++11 contains <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11" target="_blank"> significant changes</a>
both to the language and libraries.</p>
<p>C++11 was the official standard until august 2014, and is supported by most
C++ compilers. It standardizes some common C++ extensions that we use already,
allows shorthands for some operations, and has some performance and safety
improvements.</p>
<p>The C++11 standard is substantially more complex than its predecessor (1,300
pages versus 800 pages), and is unfamiliar to many developers. The long-term
effects of some features on code readability and maintenance are unknown. We
cannot predict when its various features will be implemented uniformly by
tools that may be of interest, particularly in the case of projects that are
forced to use older versions of tools.</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Boost" target="_blank">Boost</a>, some
C++11 extensions encourage coding practices that hamper readability&#x2014;for
example by removing checked redundancy (such as type names) that may be
helpful to readers, or by encouraging template metaprogramming. Other
extensions duplicate functionality available through existing mechanisms,
which may lead to confusion and conversion costs.</p>
<p>C++11 features may be used unless specified otherwise. In addition to what&apos;s
described in the rest of the style guide, the following C++11 features may not
be used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile-time rational numbers (<code>&lt;ratio&gt;</code>), because of concerns that it&apos;s tied to a more template-heavy interface style.</li>
<li>The <code>&lt;cfenv&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;fenv.h&gt;</code> headers, because many compilers do not support those features reliably.</li>
<li>Ref-qualifiers on member functions, such as <code>void X::Foo() &amp;</code> or <code>void X::Foo() &amp;&amp;</code>, because of concerns that they&apos;re an overly obscure feature.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nonstandard-extensions"><a name="nonstandard-extensions" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#nonstandard-extensions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Nonstandard Extensions<img src="Google C++ Style Guide_files/link.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Nonstandard extensions to C++ may not be used unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p>Compilers support various extensions that are not part of standard C++. Such
extensions include GCC&apos;s <code>__attribute__</code>, intrinsic functions such as
<code>__builtin_prefetch</code>, designated initializers (e.g. <code>Foo f = {.field = 3}</code>),
inline assembly, <code>__COUNTER__</code>, <code>__PRETTY_FUNCTION__</code>, compound statement
expressions (e.g. <code>foo = ({ int x; Bar(&amp;x); x })</code>, variable-length arrays and
<code>alloca()</code>, and the <code>a?:b</code> syntax.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nonstandard extensions may provide useful features that do not exist in standard C++. For example, some people think that designated initializers are more readable than standard C++ features like constructors.</li>
<li><p>Important performance guidance to the compiler can only be specified using extensions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Nonstandard extensions do not work in all compilers. Use of nonstandard extensions reduces portability of code.</p>
</li>
<li>Even if they are supported in all targeted compilers, the extensions are often not well-specified, and there may be subtle behavior differences between compilers.</li>
<li>Nonstandard extensions add to the language features that a reader must know to understand the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not use nonstandard extensions. You may use portability wrappers that are
implemented using nonstandard extensions, so long as those wrappers are
provided by a designated project-wide portability header.</p>
<h3 id="aliases"><a name="aliases" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#aliases"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Aliases<img src="Google C++ Style Guide_files/link.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Public aliases are for the benefit of an API&apos;s user, and should be clearly
documented.</p>
<p>There are several ways to create names that are aliases of other entities:</p>
<pre><code>typedef Foo Bar;
using Bar = Foo;
using other_namespace::Foo;
</code></pre><p>Like other declarations, aliases declared in a header file are part of that
header&apos;s public API unless they&apos;re in a function definition, in the private
portion of a class, or in an explicitly-marked internal namespace. Aliases in
such areas or in .cc files are implementation details (because client code
can&apos;t refer to them), and are not restricted by this rule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Aliases can improve readability by simplifying a long or complicated name.</li>
<li><p>Aliases can reduce duplication by naming in one place a type used repeatedly in an API, which <em>might</em> make it easier to change the type later. </p>
</li>
<li><p>When placed in a header where client code can refer to them, aliases increase the number of entities in that header&apos;s API, increasing its complexity.</p>
</li>
<li>Clients can easily rely on unintended details of public aliases, making changes difficult.</li>
<li>It can be tempting to create a public alias that is only intended for use in the implementation, without considering its impact on the API, or on maintainability.</li>
<li>Aliases can create risk of name collisions</li>
<li>Aliases can reduce readability by giving a familiar construct an unfamiliar name</li>
<li>Type aliases can create an unclear API contract: it is unclear whether the alias is guaranteed to be identical to the type it aliases, to have the same API, or only to be usable in specified narrow ways</li>
</ul>
<p>Don&apos;t put an alias in your public API just to save typing in the
implementation; do so only if you intend it to be used by your clients.</p>
<p>When defining a public alias, document the intent of the new name, including
whether it is guaranteed to always be the same as the type it&apos;s currently
aliased to, or whether a more limited compatibility is intended. This lets the
user know whether they can treat the types as substitutable or whether more
specific rules must be followed, and can help the implementation retain some
degree of freedom to change the alias.</p>
<p>Don&apos;t put namespace aliases in your public API. (See also
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Namespaces" target="_blank">Namespaces</a>).</p>
<p>For example, these aliases document how they are intended to be used in client
code:</p>
<pre><code>namespace a {
// Used to store field measurements. DataPoint may change from Bar* to some internal type.
// Client code should treat it as an opaque pointer.
using DataPoint = foo::bar::Bar*;

// A set of measurements. Just an alias for user convenience.
using TimeSeries = std::unordered_set&lt;DataPoint, std::hash&lt;DataPoint&gt;, DataPointComparator&gt;;
}  // namespace a
</code></pre><p>These aliases don&apos;t document intended use, and half of them aren&apos;t meant for
client use:</p>
<pre><code>namespace a {
// Bad: none of these say how they should be used.
using DataPoint = foo::bar::Bar*;
using std::unordered_set;  // Bad: just for local convenience
using std::hash;           // Bad: just for local convenience
typedef unordered_set&lt;DataPoint, hash&lt;DataPoint&gt;, DataPointComparator&gt; TimeSeries;
}  // namespace a
</code></pre><p>However, local convenience aliases are fine in function definitions, private
sections of classes, explicitly marked internal namespaces, and in .cc files:</p>
<pre><code>// In a .cc file
using std::unordered_set;
</code></pre><h2 id="naming"><a name="naming" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#naming"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.12.1. Naming</h2>
<p>The most important consistency rules are those that govern naming. The style
of a name immediately informs us what sort of thing the named entity is: a
type, a variable, a function, a constant, a macro, etc., without requiring us
to search for the declaration of that entity. The pattern-matching engine in
our brains relies a great deal on these naming rules.</p>
<p>Naming rules are pretty arbitrary, but we feel that consistency is more
important than individual preferences in this area, so regardless of whether
you find them sensible or not, the rules are the rules.</p>
<h3 id="general-naming-rules"><a name="general-naming-rules" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#general-naming-rules"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.12.1.1. General Naming Rules</h3>
<p>Names should be descriptive; avoid abbreviation.</p>
<p>Give as descriptive a name as possible, within reason. Do not worry about
saving horizontal space as it is far more important to make your code
immediately understandable by a new reader. Do not use abbreviations that are
ambiguous or unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate
by deleting letters within a word.</p>
<pre><code>int price_count_reader;    // No abbreviation.
int num_errors;            // &quot;num&quot; is a widespread convention.
int num_dns_connections;   // Most people know what &quot;DNS&quot; stands for.



int n;                     // Meaningless.
int nerr;                  // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int n_comp_conns;          // Ambiguous abbreviation.
int wgc_connections;       // Only your group knows what this stands for.
int pc_reader;             // Lots of things can be abbreviated &quot;pc&quot;.
int cstmr_id;              // Deletes internal letters.
</code></pre><p>Note that certain universally-known abbreviations are OK, such as <code>i</code> for an
iteration variable and <code>T</code> for a template parameter.</p>
<p>Template parameters should follow the naming style for their category: type
template parameters should follow the rules for <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Type_Names" target="_blank">type
names</a>, and non-
type template parameters should follow the rules for <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Variable_Names" target="_blank"> variable
names</a>.</p>
<h3 id="file-names"><a name="file-names" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#file-names"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.12.1.2. File Names</h3>
<p>Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores (<code>_</code>) or dashes
(<code>-</code>). Follow the convention that your project uses. If there is no consistent
local pattern to follow, prefer &quot;_&quot;.</p>
<p>Examples of acceptable file names:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>my_useful_class.cc</code></li>
<li><code>my-useful-class.cc</code></li>
<li><code>myusefulclass.cc</code></li>
<li><code>myusefulclass_test.cc // _unittest and _regtest are deprecated.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>C++ files should end in <code>.cc</code> and header files should end in <code>.h</code>. Files that
rely on being textually included at specific points should end in <code>.inc</code> (see
also the section on <a href="https://google.github.io/stylegui
de/cppguide.html#Self_contained_Headers" target="_blank">self-contained headers</a>).</p>
<p>Do not use filenames that already exist in <code>/usr/include</code>, such as <code>db.h</code>.</p>
<p>In general, make your filenames very specific. For example, use
<code>http_server_logs.h</code> rather than <code>logs.h</code>. A very common case is to have a
pair of files called, e.g., <code>foo_bar.h</code> and <code>foo_bar.cc</code>, defining a class
called <code>FooBar</code>.</p>
<p>Inline functions must be in a <code>.h</code> file. If your inline functions are very
short, they should go directly into your <code>.h</code> file.</p>

<p>The names of all types &#x2014; classes, structs, type aliases, enums, and type

with a capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. No
underscores. For example:</p>

<p>Variables declared constexpr or const, and whose value is fixed for the

<p>Regular functions have mixed case; accessors and mutators may be named like
variables.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, functions should start with a capital letter and have a capital
letter for each new word (a.k.a. &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" target="_blank">Camel
Case</a>&quot; or &quot;Pascal case&quot;). Such names
should not have underscores. Prefer to capitalize acronyms as single words
(i.e. <code>StartRpc()</code>, not <code>StartRPC()</code>).</p>
<pre><code>AddTableEntry()
DeleteUrl()
OpenFileOrDie()
</code></pre><p>(The same naming rule applies to class- and namespace-scope constants that are
exposed as part of an API and that are intended to look like functions,
because the fact that they&apos;re objects rather than functions is an unimportant
implementation detail.)</p>
<p>Accessors and mutators (get and set functions) may be named like variables.
These often correspond to actual member variables, but this is not required.
For example, <code>int count()</code> and <code>void set_count(int count)</code>.</p>
<h3 id="namespace-names"><a name="namespace-names" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#namespace-names"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Namespace Names<img src="Google C++ Style Guide_files/link.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Namespace names are all lower-case. Top-level namespace names are based on the
project name . Avoid collisions between nested namespaces and well-known top-
level namespaces.</p>
<p>The name of a top-level namespace should usually be the name of the project or
team whose code is contained in that namespace. The code in that namespace
should usually be in a directory whose basename matches the namespace name (or
subdirectories thereof).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#General_Naming_Rules" target="_blank">rule against abbreviated
names</a>
applies to namespaces just as much as variable names. Code inside the
namespace seldom needs to mention the namespace name, so there&apos;s usually no
particular need for abbreviation anyway.</p>
<p>Avoid nested namespaces that match well-known top-level namespaces. Collisions
between namespace names can lead to surprising build breaks because of name
lookup rules. In particular, do not create any nested <code>std</code> namespaces. Prefer
unique project identifiers (<code>websearch::index</code>, <code>websearch::index_util</code>) over
collision-prone names like <code>websearch::util</code>.</p>
<p>For <code>internal</code> namespaces, be wary of other code being added to the same
<code>internal</code> namespace causing a collision (internal helpers within a team tend
to be related and may lead to collisions). In such a situation, using the
filename to make a unique internal name is helpful
(<code>websearch::index::frobber_internal</code> for use in <code>frobber.h</code>)</p>
<h3 id="enumerator-names"><a name="enumerator-names" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#enumerator-names"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Enumerator Names<img src="Google C++ Style Guide_files/link.png" alt=""></h3>
<p>Enumerators (for both scoped and unscoped enums) should be named <em>either</em> like
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Constant_Names" target="_blank">constants</a>
or like
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Macro_Names" target="_blank">macros</a>:
either <code>kEnumName</code> or <code>ENUM_NAME</code>.</p>
<p>Preferably, the individual enumerators should be named like
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Constant_Names" target="_blank">constants</a>.
However, it is also acceptable to name them like
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Macro_Names" target="_blank">macros</a>. The
enumeration name, <code>UrlTableErrors</code> (and <code>AlternateUrlTableErrors</code>), is a type,
and therefore mixed case.</p>
<pre><code>enum UrlTableErrors {
  kOK = 0,
  kErrorOutOfMemory,
  kErrorMalformedInput,
};
enum AlternateUrlTableErrors {
  OK = 0,
  OUT_OF_MEMORY = 1,
  MALFORMED_INPUT = 2,
};
</code></pre><p>Until January 2009, the style was to name enum values like
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Macro_Names" target="_blank">macros</a>. This
caused problems with name collisions between enum values and macros. Hence,
the change to prefer constant-style naming was put in place. New code should
prefer constant-style naming if possible. However, there is no reason to
change old code to use constant-style names, unless the old names are actually
causing a compile-time problem.</p>

not at the file level.</p>

how and when to use the class, as well as any additional considerations
necessary to correctly use the class. Document the synchronization assumptions
the class makes, if any. If an instance of the class can be accessed by
multiple threads, take extra care to document the rules and invariants

<h4 id="function-declarations"><a name="function-declarations" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#function-declarations"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Function Declarations</h4>
<p>Almost every function declaration should have comments immediately preceding
it that describe what the function does and how to use it. These comments may
be omitted only if the function is simple and obvious (e.g. simple accessors
for obvious properties of the class). These comments should be descriptive
(&quot;Opens the file&quot;) rather than imperative (&quot;Open the file&quot;); the comment
describes the function, it does not tell the function what to do. In general,
these comments do not describe how the function performs its task. Instead,
that should be left to comments in the function definition.</p>
<p>Types of things to mention in comments at the function declaration:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the inputs and outputs are.</li>
<li>For class member functions: whether the object remembers reference arguments beyond the duration of the method call, and whether it will free them or not.</li>
<li>If the function allocates memory that the caller must free.</li>
<li>Whether any of the arguments can be a null pointer.</li>
<li>If there are any performance implications of how a function is used.</li>
<li>If the function is re-entrant. What are its synchronization assumptions?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>// Returns an iterator for this table.  It is the client&apos;s
// responsibility to delete the iterator when it is done with it,
// and it must not use the iterator once the GargantuanTable object
// on which the iterator was created has been deleted.
//
// The iterator is initially positioned at the beginning of the table.
//
// This method is equivalent to:
//    Iterator* iter = table-&gt;NewIterator();
//    iter-&gt;Seek(&quot;&quot;);
//    return iter;
// If you are going to immediately seek to another place in the
// returned iterator, it will be faster to use NewIterator()
// and avoid the extra seek.
Iterator* GetIterator() const;
</code></pre><p>However, do not be unnecessarily verbose or state the completely obvious.
Notice below that it is not necessary to say &quot;returns false otherwise&quot; because
this is implied.</p>
<pre><code>// Returns true if the table cannot hold any more entries.
bool IsTableFull();
</code></pre><p>When documenting function overrides, focus on the specifics of the override
itself, rather than repeating the comment from the overridden function. In
many of these cases, the override needs no additional documentation and thus
no comment is required.</p>
<p>When commenting constructors and destructors, remember that the person reading
your code knows what constructors and destructors are for, so comments that
just say something like &quot;destroys this object&quot; are not useful. Document what
constructors do with their arguments (for example, if they take ownership of
pointers), and what cleanup the destructor does. If this is trivial, just skip
the comment. It is quite common for destructors not to have a header comment.</p>
<h4 id="function-definitions"><a name="function-definitions" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#function-definitions"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Function Definitions</h4>
<p>If there is anything tricky about how a function does its job, the function
definition should have an explanatory comment. For example, in the definition
comment you might describe any coding tricks you use, give an overview of the
steps you go through, or explain why you chose to implement the function in
the way you did rather than using a viable alternative. For instance, you
might mention why it must acquire a lock for the first half of the function
but why it is not needed for the second half.</p>
<p>Note you should <em>not</em> just repeat the comments given with the function
declaration, in the <code>.h</code> file or wherever. It&apos;s okay to recapitulate briefly
what the function does, but the focus of the comments should be on how it does
it.</p>
<h3 id="variable-comments"><a name="variable-comments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#variable-comments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.13.1.5. Variable Comments</h3>
<p>In general the actual name of the variable should be descriptive enough to
give a good idea of what the variable is used for. In certain cases, more
comments are required.</p>
<h4 id="class-data-members_1"><a name="class-data-members_1" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#class-data-members_1"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Class Data Members</h4>
<p>The purpose of each class data member (also called an instance variable or
member variable) must be clear. If there are any invariants (special values,
relationships between members, lifetime requirements) not clearly expressed by
the type and name, they must be commented. However, if the type and name
suffice (<code>int num_events_;</code>), no comment is needed.</p>
<p>In particular, add comments to describe the existence and meaning of sentinel
values, such as nullptr or -1, when they are not obvious. For example:</p>
<pre><code>private:
 // Used to bounds-check table accesses. -1 means
 // that we don&apos;t yet know how many entries the table has.
 int num_total_entries_;
</code></pre><h4 id="global-variables"><a name="global-variables" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#global-variables"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Global Variables</h4>
<p>All global variables should have a comment describing what they are, what they
are used for, and (if unclear) why it needs to be global. For example:</p>
<pre><code>// The total number of tests cases that we run through in this regression test.
const int kNumTestCases = 6;
</code></pre><h3 id="implementation-comments"><a name="implementation-comments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#implementation-comments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.13.1.6. Implementation Comments</h3>
<p>In your implementation you should have comments in tricky, non-obvious,
interesting, or important parts of your code.</p>
<h4 id="explanatory-comments"><a name="explanatory-comments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#explanatory-comments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Explanatory Comments</h4>
<p>Tricky or complicated code blocks should have comments before them. Example:</p>
<pre><code>// Divide result by two, taking into account that x
// contains the carry from the add.
for (int i = 0; i &lt; result-&gt;size(); i++) {
  x = (x &lt;&lt; 8) + (*result)[i];
  (*result)[i] = x &gt;&gt; 1;
  x &amp;= 1;
}
</code></pre><h4 id="line-comments"><a name="line-comments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#line-comments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Line Comments</h4>
<p>Also, lines that are non-obvious should get a comment at the end of the line.
These end-of-line comments should be separated from the code by 2 spaces.
Example:</p>
<pre><code>// If we have enough memory, mmap the data portion too.
mmap_budget = max&lt;int64&gt;(0, mmap_budget - index_-&gt;length());
if (mmap_budget &gt;= data_size_ &amp;&amp; !MmapData(mmap_chunk_bytes, mlock))
  return;  // Error already logged.
</code></pre><p>Note that there are both comments that describe what the code is doing, and
comments that mention that an error has already been logged when the function
returns.</p>
<p>If you have several comments on subsequent lines, it can often be more
readable to line them up:</p>
<pre><code>DoSomething();                  // Comment here so the comments line up.
DoSomethingElseThatIsLonger();  // Two spaces between the code and the comment.
{ // One space before comment when opening a new scope is allowed,
  // thus the comment lines up with the following comments and code.
  DoSomethingElse();  // Two spaces before line comments normally.
}
std::vector&lt;string&gt; list{
                    // Comments in braced lists describe the next element...
                    &quot;First item&quot;,
                    // .. and should be aligned appropriately.
                    &quot;Second item&quot;};
DoSomething(); /* For trailing block comments, one space is fine. */
</code></pre><h4 id="function-argument-comments"><a name="function-argument-comments" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#function-argument-comments"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Function Argument Comments</h4>
<p>When the meaning of a function argument is nonobvious, consider one of the
following remedies:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the argument is a literal constant, and the same constant is used in multiple function calls in a way that tacitly assumes they&apos;re the same, you should use a named constant to make that constraint explicit, and to guarantee that it holds.</li>
<li>Consider changing the function signature to replace a <code>bool</code> argument with an <code>enum</code> argument. This will make the argument values self-describing.</li>
<li>For functions that have several configuration options, consider defining a single class or struct to hold all the options , and pass an instance of that. This approach has several advantages. Options are referenced by name at the call site, which clarifies their meaning. It also reduces function argument count, which makes function calls easier to read and write. As an added benefit, you don&apos;t have to change call sites when you add another option. </li>
<li>Replace large or complex nested expressions with named variables.</li>
<li>As a last resort, use comments to clarify argument meanings at the call site.
Consider the following example:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>// What are these arguments?
const DecimalNumber product = CalculateProduct(values, 7, false, nullptr);
</code></pre><p>versus:</p>
<pre><code>ProductOptions options;
options.set_precision_decimals(7);
options.set_use_cache(ProductOptions::kDontUseCache);
const DecimalNumber product =
    CalculateProduct(values, options, /*completion_callback=*/nullptr);
</code></pre><h4 id="donts"><a name="donts" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#donts"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>Don&apos;ts</h4>
<p>Do not state the obvious. In particular, don&apos;t literally describe what code
does, unless the behavior is nonobvious to a reader who understands C++ well.
Instead, provide higher level comments that describe <em>why</em> the code does what
it does, or make the code self describing.</p>
<p>Compare this:</p>
<pre><code>// Find the element in the vector.  &lt;-- Bad: obvious!
auto iter = std::find(v.begin(), v.end(), element);
if (iter != v.end()) {
  Process(element);
}
</code></pre><p>To this:</p>
<pre><code>// Process &quot;element&quot; unless it was already processed.
auto iter = std::find(v.begin(), v.end(), element);
if (iter != v.end()) {
  Process(element);
}
</code></pre><p>Self-describing code doesn&apos;t need a comment. The comment from the example
above would be obvious:</p>
<pre><code>if (!IsAlreadyProcessed(element)) {
  Process(element);
}
</code></pre><h3 id="punctuation-spelling-and-grammargoogle-c-style"><a name="punctuation-spelling-and-grammargoogle-c-style" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#punctuation-spelling-and-grammargoogle-c-style"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.13.1.7. Punctuation, Spelling and Grammar![](./Google C++ Style</h3>
<p>Guide_files/link.png)</p>
<p>Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read
well-written comments than badly written ones.</p>
<p>Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization
and punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than
sentence fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of
code, can sometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your
style.</p>
<p>Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are
using a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that
source code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper
punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.</p>

<p>Use <code>TODO</code> comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.</p>
<p><code>TODO</code>s should include the string <code>TODO</code> in all caps, followed by the name,
e-mail address, bug ID, or other identifier of the person or issue with the
best context about the problem referenced by the <code>TODO</code>. The main purpose is
to have a consistent <code>TODO</code> that can be searched to find out how to get more
details upon request. A <code>TODO</code> is not a commitment that the person referenced
will fix the problem. Thus when you create a <code>TODO</code> with a name, it is almost
always your name that is given.</p>
<pre><code>// TODO(kl@gmail.com): Use a &quot;*&quot; here for concatenation operator.
// TODO(Zeke) change this to use relations.
// TODO(bug 12345): remove the &quot;Last visitors&quot; feature
</code></pre><p>If your <code>TODO</code> is of the form &quot;At a future date do something&quot; make sure that
you either include a very specific date (&quot;Fix by November 2005&quot;) or a very
specific event (&quot;Remove this code when all clients can handle XML
responses.&quot;).</p>

<p>Mark deprecated interface points with <code>DEPRECATED</code> comments.</p>
<p>You can mark an interface as deprecated by writing a comment containing the
word <code>DEPRECATED</code> in all caps. The comment goes either before the declaration
of the interface or on the same line as the declaration.</p>
<p>After the word <code>DEPRECATED</code>, write your name, e-mail address, or other
identifier in parentheses.</p>
<p>A deprecation comment must include simple, clear directions for people to fix
their callsites. In C++, you can implement a deprecated function as an inline
function that calls the new interface point.</p>
<p>Marking an interface point <code>DEPRECATED</code> will not magically cause any callsites
to change. If you want people to actually stop using the deprecated facility,
you will have to fix the callsites yourself or recruit a crew to help you.</p>
<p>New code should not contain calls to deprecated interface points. Use the new
interface point instead. If you cannot understand the directions, find the
person who created the deprecation and ask them for help using the new
interface point.</p>
<h2 id="formatting"><a name="formatting" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#formatting"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.13.2. Formatting</h2>
<p>Coding style and formatting are pretty arbitrary, but a project is much easier
to follow if everyone uses the same style. Individuals may not agree with
every aspect of the formatting rules, and some of the rules may take some
getting used to, but it is important that all project contributors follow the
style rules so that they can all read and understand everyone&apos;s code easily.</p>
<p>To help you format code correctly, we&apos;ve created a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/styleguide/gh-

emacs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="line-length"><a name="line-length" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#line-length"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.13.2.1. Line Length</h3>
<p>Each line of text in your code should be at most 80 characters long.</p>
<p>We recognize that this rule is controversial, but so much existing code
already adheres to it, and we feel that consistency is important.</p>
<p>Those who favor this rule argue that it is rude to force them to resize their
windows and there is no need for anything longer. Some folks are used to
having several code windows side-by-side, and thus don&apos;t have room to widen
their windows in any case. People set up their work environment assuming a
particular maximum window width, and 80 columns has been the traditional
standard. Why change it?</p>
<p>Proponents of change argue that a wider line can make code more readable. The
80-column limit is an hidebound throwback to 1960s mainframes; modern
equipment has wide screens that can easily show longer lines.</p>
<p>80 characters is the maximum.</p>
<p>Comment lines can be longer than 80 characters if it is not feasible to split
them without harming readability, ease of cut and paste or auto-linking --
e.g. if a line contains an example command or a literal URL longer than 80
characters.</p>
<p>A raw-string literal may have content that exceeds 80 characters. Except for
test code, such literals should appear near the top of a file.</p>
<p>An <code>#include</code> statement with a long path may exceed 80 columns.</p>
<p>You needn&apos;t be concerned about <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#The__define_Guard" target="_blank">header
guards</a>
that exceed the maximum length.</p>

<p>Non-ASCII characters should be rare, and must use UTF-8 formatting.</p>
<p>You shouldn&apos;t hard-code user-facing text in source, even English, so use of
non-ASCII characters should be rare. However, in certain cases it is
appropriate to include such words in your code. For example, if your code
parses data files from foreign sources, it may be appropriate to hard-code the
non-ASCII string(s) used in those data files as delimiters. More commonly,
unittest code (which does not need to be localized) might contain non-ASCII
strings. In such cases, you should use UTF-8, since that is an encoding
understood by most tools able to handle more than just ASCII.</p>
<p>Hex encoding is also OK, and encouraged where it enhances readability &#x2014; for
example, <code>&quot;\xEF\xBB\xBF&quot;</code>, or, even more simply, <code>u8&quot;\uFEFF&quot;</code>, is the Unicode
zero-width no-break space character, which would be invisible if included in
the source as straight UTF-8.</p>
<p>Use the <code>u8</code> prefix to guarantee that a string literal containing <code>\uXXXX</code>
escape sequences is encoded as UTF-8. Do not use it for strings containing
non-ASCII characters encoded as UTF-8, because that will produce incorrect
output if the compiler does not interpret the source file as UTF-8.</p>
<p>You shouldn&apos;t use the C++11 <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> character types, since
they&apos;re for non-UTF-8 text. For similar reasons you also shouldn&apos;t use
<code>wchar_t</code> (unless you&apos;re writing code that interacts with the Windows API,
which uses <code>wchar_t</code> extensively).</p>

<li>Parameter names may be omitted only if the parameter is unused and its purpose is obvious.</li>
<li>If you cannot fit the return type and the function name on a single line, break between them.</li>
<li>If you break after the return type of a function declaration or definition, do not indent.</li>
<li>The open parenthesis is always on the same line as the function name.</li>
<li>There is never a space between the function name and the open parenthesis.</li>
<li>There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters.</li>
<li>The open curly brace is always on the end of the last line of the function declaration, not the start of the next line.</li>
<li>The close curly brace is either on the last line by itself or on the same line as the open curly brace.</li>
<li>There should be a space between the close parenthesis and the open curly brace.</li>

<p>Either write the call all on a single line, wrap the arguments at the

continue at that 4 space indent. In the absence of other considerations, use

<p>Function calls have the following format:</p>
<pre><code>bool result = DoSomething(argument1, argument2, argument3);
</code></pre><p>If the arguments do not all fit on one line, they should be broken up onto
multiple lines, with each subsequent line aligned with the first argument. Do
not add spaces after the open paren or before the close paren:</p>

        argument3, argument4);
    ...
  }
</code></pre><p>Put multiple arguments on a single line to reduce the number of lines
necessary for calling a function unless there is a specific readability
problem. Some find that formatting with strictly one argument on each line is
more readable and simplifies editing of the arguments. However, we prioritize
for the reader over the ease of editing arguments, and most readability
problems are better addressed with the following techniques.</p>
<p>If having multiple arguments in a single line decreases readability due to the
complexity or confusing nature of the expressions that make up some arguments,
try creating variables that capture those arguments in a descriptive name:</p>
<pre><code>int my_heuristic = scores[x] * y + bases[x];
bool result = DoSomething(my_heuristic, x, y, z);
</code></pre><p>Or put the confusing argument on its own line with an explanatory comment:</p>
<pre><code>bool result = DoSomething(scores[x] * y + bases[x],  // Score heuristic.
                          x, y, z);
</code></pre><p>If there is still a case where one argument is significantly more readable on
its own line, then put it on its own line. The decision should be specific to
the argument which is made more readable rather than a general policy.</p>
<p>Sometimes arguments form a structure that is important for readability. In
those cases, feel free to format the arguments according to that structure:</p>
<pre><code>// Transform the widget by a 3x3 matrix.
my_widget.Transform(x1, x2, x3,
                    y1, y2, y3,

<p>Prefer no spaces inside parentheses. The <code>if</code> and <code>else</code> keywords belong on
separate lines.</p>
<p>There are two acceptable formats for a basic conditional statement. One
includes spaces between the parentheses and the condition, and one does not.</p>
<p>The most common form is without spaces. Either is fine, but <em>be consistent</em>.
If you are modifying a file, use the format that is already present. If you
are writing new code, use the format that the other files in that directory or
project use. If in doubt and you have no personal preference, do not add the
spaces.</p>
<pre><code>if (condition) {  // no spaces inside parentheses
  ...  // 2 space indent.
} else if (...) {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>If you prefer you may add spaces inside the parentheses:</p>
<pre><code>if ( condition ) {  // spaces inside parentheses - rare
  ...  // 2 space indent.
} else {  // The else goes on the same line as the closing brace.
  ...
}
</code></pre><p>Note that in all cases you must have a space between the <code>if</code> and the open
parenthesis. You must also have a space between the close parenthesis and the
curly brace, if you&apos;re using one.</p>
<pre><code>if(condition) {   // Bad - space missing after IF.
if (condition){   // Bad - space missing before {.
if(condition){    // Doubly bad.



if (condition) {  // Good - proper space after IF and before {.
</code></pre><p>Short conditional statements may be written on one line if this enhances
readability. You may use this only when the line is brief and the statement
does not use the <code>else</code> clause.</p>
<pre><code>if (x == kFoo) return new Foo();
if (x == kBar) return new Bar();
</code></pre><p>This is not allowed when the if statement has an <code>else</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// Not allowed - IF statement on one line when there is an ELSE clause
if (x) DoThis();
else DoThat();
</code></pre><p>In general, curly braces are not required for single-line statements, but they
are allowed if you like them; conditional or loop statements with complex
conditions or statements may be more readable with curly braces. Some projects
require that an <code>if</code> must always always have an accompanying brace.</p>
<pre><code>if (condition)
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent.

if (condition) {
  DoSomething();  // 2 space indent.
}
</code></pre><p>However, if one part of an <code>if</code>-<code>else</code> statement uses curly braces, the other
part must too:</p>
<pre><code>// Not allowed - curly on IF but not ELSE
if (condition) {
  foo;
} else
  bar;

// Not allowed - curly on ELSE but not IF
if (condition)
  foo;
else {
  bar;
}



// Curly braces around both IF and ELSE required because
// one of the clauses used braces.
if (condition) {
  foo;
} else {
  bar;
}

<p>Switch statements may use braces for blocks. Annotate non-trivial fall-through
between cases. Braces are optional for single-statement loops. Empty loop
bodies should use empty braces or <code>continue</code>.</p>
<p><code>case</code> blocks in <code>switch</code> statements can have curly braces or not, depending
on your preference. If you do include curly braces they should be placed as
shown below.</p>
<p>If not conditional on an enumerated value, switch statements should always
have a <code>default</code> case (in the case of an enumerated value, the compiler will
warn you if any values are not handled). If the default case should never
execute, simply <code>assert</code>:</p>
<pre><code>switch (var) {
  case 0: {  // 2 space indent
    ...      // 4 space indent
    break;
  }

single semicolon.</p>
<pre><code>while (condition) {
  // Repeat test until it returns false.
}
for (int i = 0; i &lt; kSomeNumber; ++i) {}  // Good - one newline is also OK.

<pre><code>// These are fine, space preceding.

<p>When you have a boolean expression that is longer than the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Line_Length" target="_blank">standard line
length</a>, be
consistent in how you break up the lines.</p>
<p>In this example, the logical AND operator is always at the end of the lines:</p>
<pre><code>if (this_one_thing &gt; this_other_thing &amp;&amp;
    a_third_thing == a_fourth_thing &amp;&amp;
    yet_another &amp;&amp; last_one) {

operators are at the end of the line. This is more common in Google code,
though wrapping all operators at the beginning of the line is also allowed.
Feel free to insert extra parentheses judiciously because they can be very
helpful in increasing readability when used appropriately. Also note that you
should always use the punctuation operators, such as <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>~</code>, rather than
the word operators, such as <code>and</code> and <code>compl</code>.</p>

</code></pre><p>Be careful when using a braced initialization list <code>{...}</code> on a type with an
<code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor. A nonempty <em>braced-init-list</em> prefers the
<code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor whenever possible. Note that empty braces
<code>{}</code> are special, and will call a default constructor if available. To force
the non-<code>std::initializer_list</code> constructor, use parentheses instead of
braces.</p>
<pre><code>std::vector&lt;int&gt; v(100, 1);  // A vector of 100 1s.
std::vector&lt;int&gt; v{100, 1};  // A vector of 100, 1.
</code></pre><p>Also, the brace form prevents narrowing of integral types. This can prevent
some types of programming errors.</p>
<pre><code>int pi(3.14);  // OK -- pi == 3.
int pi{3.14};  // Compile error: narrowing conversion.

<p>Minimize use of vertical whitespace.</p>
<p>This is more a principle than a rule: don&apos;t use blank lines when you don&apos;t
have to. In particular, don&apos;t put more than one or two blank lines between
functions, resist starting functions with a blank line, don&apos;t end functions
with a blank line, and be discriminating with your use of blank lines inside
functions.</p>
<p>The basic principle is: The more code that fits on one screen, the easier it
is to follow and understand the control flow of the program. Of course,
readability can suffer from code being too dense as well as too spread out, so
use your judgement. But in general, minimize use of vertical whitespace.</p>
<p>Some rules of thumb to help when blank lines may be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank lines at the beginning or end of a function very rarely help readability.</li>
<li>Blank lines inside a chain of if-else blocks may well help readability.</li>

<p>Windows programmers have developed their own set of coding conventions, mainly
derived from the conventions in Windows headers and other Microsoft code. We
want to make it easy for anyone to understand your code, so we have a single
set of guidelines for everyone writing C++ on any platform.</p>
<p>It is worth reiterating a few of the guidelines that you might forget if you
are used to the prevalent Windows style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not use Hungarian notation (for example, naming an integer <code>iNum</code>). Use the Google naming conventions, including the <code>.cc</code> extension for source files.</li>
<li>Windows defines many of its own synonyms for primitive types, such as <code>DWORD</code>, <code>HANDLE</code>, etc. It is perfectly acceptable, and encouraged, that you use these types when calling Windows API functions. Even so, keep as close as you can to the underlying C++ types. For example, use <code>const TCHAR *</code> instead of <code>LPCTSTR</code>.</li>
<li>When compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, set the compiler to warning level 3 or higher, and treat all warnings as errors.</li>
<li>Do not use <code>#pragma once</code>; instead use the standard Google include guards. The path in the include guards should be relative to the top of your project tree.</li>
<li>In fact, do not use any nonstandard extensions, like <code>#pragma</code> and <code>__declspec</code>, unless you absolutely must. Using <code>__declspec(dllimport)</code> and <code>__declspec(dllexport)</code> is allowed; however, you must use them through macros such as <code>DLLIMPORT</code> and <code>DLLEXPORT</code>, so that someone can easily disable the extensions if they share the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are just a few rules that we occasionally need to break on
Windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normally we <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Multiple_Inheritance" target="_blank">forbid the use of multiple implementation inheritance</a>; however, it is required when using COM and some ATL/WTL classes. You may use multiple implementation inheritance to implement COM or ATL/WTL classes and interfaces.</li>
<li>Although you should not use exceptions in your own code, they are used extensively in the ATL and some STLs, including the one that comes with Visual C++. When using the ATL, you should define <code>_ATL_NO_EXCEPTIONS</code> to disable exceptions. You should investigate whether you can also disable exceptions in your STL, but if not, it is OK to turn on exceptions in the compiler. (Note that this is only to get the STL to compile. You should still not write exception handling code yourself.)</li>
<li>The usual way of working with precompiled headers is to include a header file at the top of each source file, typically with a name like <code>StdAfx.h</code> or <code>precompile.h</code>. To make your code easier to share with other projects, avoid including this file explicitly (except in <code>precompile.cc</code>), and use the <code>/FI</code> compiler option to include the file automatically.</li>
<li>Resource headers, which are usually named <code>resource.h</code> and contain only macros, do not need to conform to these style guidelines.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="parting-words"><a name="parting-words" class="anchor-navigation-ex-anchor" href="#parting-words"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>1.12.13.4. Parting Words</h2>
<p>Use common sense and <em>BE CONSISTENT</em>.</p>
<p>If you are editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
determine its style. If they use spaces around their <code>if</code> clauses, you should,
too. If their comments have little boxes of stars around them, make your
comments have little boxes of stars around them too.</p>
<p>The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding
so people can concentrate on what you are saying, rather than on how you are
saying it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary.
But local style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically
different from the existing code around it, the discontinuity throws readers
out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Try to avoid this.</p>
<p>OK, enough writing about writing code; the code itself is much more
interesting. Have fun!</p>
